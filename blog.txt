So, I knew it was going to be cold on Thursday when the NPR 5 minute news brief, which sticks to big stories like terrorists taking control of Israel or massive protests by fundamentalists, had a guy from the National Weather Service on saying, "This is going to be the first arctic air burst we've had all year; it's going to be quite cold."

BODY:
Anyone who has used Unix or a derivative for long enough should know of crypt(3), the basic Unix hashing function.  Back In The Day, unices used crypt(3) for hashing passwords and It Was Good; computers were once slow enough that DES was an acceptable encryption algorithm even with a limit of 8 characters.  Since about the turn of the century (the latest one), any Unix worth it's salt (heh, crypto pun) offers other options for password encryption, most often MD5.  Furthermore, everything I've run into, until today, used MD5 passwords by default, though Debian Potato still offered to use crypt(3) and non-shadowed passwords (knowing that came in useful in a cracking competition my freshman year).

Getting to the point, I logged into a Solaris machine that I set up recently and typed the password wrong, but it let me in.  At first I was...quite scared.  I logged in again, carefully typing the root password and was granted access.  I recalled the crypt(3) function...I logged in, typing the first 8 characters carefully and garbage for the rest.  I got in.  Long story short, Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) still uses crypt(3) as the default password encryption.  It's a simple fix, you just change a line in `/etc/security/policy.conf`, but still sort of apalling none the less.

I listen to a lot handful of radio shows that feature call in segments including, <a href="http://2600.net">2600</a>'s <a href="http://2600.net/oth">Off The Hook</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/scifri/">TOTN: Science Friday</a>.  Allowing listeners to call in is something of a mixed blessing; you get to hear some interesting questions from different viewpoints than that of the host but said views are spoken by people who seem to be completely new to radio.  Callers seem to have never listend to the show in question - or any show, for that matter - nor do they exhibit knowledge of how to use a telephone.  More often than not, the caller is flabbergasted by the fact that can hear themselves from their mouth, the telephone and the radio simultaneously and proceed to blabber for some time questioning whether they really are on the air.  Thereafter, it is standard practice to have a long, drawn out explination of the problem/question, which could have been summed up in one sentance.  The caller shall then utterly mis-interpret the answer they were given and attempt to ask the same question, at which point the astute radio host cuts them off.

In conclusion, if you're going to call in to a radio show, think about what you are going to say, be prepared to say it when chosen and speak clearly.

Last night in #2600 there was talk about illwill, who frequents the channel and is going to jail soon for selling the source code to Windows.  This was a big enough story that it has been <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&ie=UTF-8&q=illwill&btnG=Search+News">in the news</a> recently, yet there wasn't a Wikipedia article for him.  I created a quick one (only a couple of sentances and a link) yet within the hour it had gone from a simple stub linking to <a href="http://illmob.org">his site</a>, to a full-fledged article.  Today, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Genovese&action=history">nearly 20 edits</a>.

Have I said how much I love Wikipedia?

BODY:
One of the well known problems with E36s is that the weak transmission mounts allow the transmission to shift slightly under load. When this happens, it becomes very easy to miss-shift and accidentally go into a lower gear then one intended. Doing so can cause a mechanical over-rev, destroying the engine. To rectify this problem, I bought UUC's Tranny Mount Enforcers.

**Parts required**

* Transmission Mounts

**Tools required**

* 16mm wrench/socket
* 13mm wrench/socket
* ramps or floor jack and jackstands
* Lock-Tite

The transmission mount install is easy. Get the car up on ramps or jackstands such that you can fit under it from the side (I did all the work from the driver's side) of the car. Once under the car, look at the tail shaft of the transmission and the bridge that goes across the transmission tunnel, supporting it. Support the tail of the transmission with your jack and then remove the bridge by undoing the four bolts that hold it onto the car as well as the two bolts that hold the mounts to the transmission. Now just replace the stock mounts that are on the bridge with your new ones and re-assemble the car.

So, apparently in Chinese culture, people send gifts to their departed love ones to ensure that their spirits live on in comfort.  One of the things that are usually sent are [Hell Bank Notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Bank_Notes), money for them to spend in the afterworld.  In other cultures, such notes are used to bribe the King of Hell, also known as the Jade Emperor or Grandpa Heaven, for the earlier release of the held spirit.  My favorite part of this Wikipedia article is the discussion of Hell Bank Note values:

> Regardless of the presentation, Hell Bank Notes are well known for their outrageously large denominations, ranging from $10,000, $100,000, $1,000,000 or even $500,000,000; **the Chinese afterlife is apparently subject to hyperinflation**.

I was reading a [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) article on [GPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS) which made a very good point: given their immense speed, the clocks GPS satellites are affected by relativity.  GPS satellites reside in an intermediate earth orbit such that the difference in the speed versus that of the surface of the Earth is quite significant.  Due to this great speed difference, the clocks on-board GPS satellites are affected by special (as well as general) relativity and as such differ from a clock on Earth's surface by about 38 microseconds per day.  For anyone who has ever been interested in relativity or quantum theory, this is an amazing example of relativity in a real-life and thoroughly used system.

Yesterday at a Martin Luther King, Jr. day event, Hillary Clinton mades some egregious remarks, only one of which has drawn attention of the media.  Had she refrained from [comparing the current political state to a plantation](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/17/clinton.plantation/), the more politically important statement that she made would have come through loud and clear.  I say that her other major point was more important because it really sums up what many people think about the current administration, but few with a voice have had the courage to say,

> We have a culture of corruption, we have cronyism, we have incompetence

> I predict to you that this administration will go down in history as one of the worst that has ever governed our country.

I really wish this quote hadn't been so overshadowed by the remark about plantations, as she was right on the mark.  Sounds like the sort of thing a vice president would say.

The other night, as I was just getting into bed, the fan on my GeForce 3 started making noise.  I know it was my GPU because it had been making noise on and off for the past couple of years and no, I hadn't replaced the fan.  Usually hitting the thing quited it down.  Unfortunately, such a barbaric solution was unsuccessful; in my wanting-to-sleep stupor, I just ripped the fan off of the stupid round stock heatsink and went back to bed, hoping the thing wouldn't overheat.  It's been three days since then and the thing is still working fine.

Like many people, since the day Google had it's IPO I was wishing that I could have gotten in on that action.  By the end of the month, when the stock continued to rise, I still sort of wished that I had bought some shortly after the IPO, but the thought of "man, $130 for a volatile internet stock? it can't keep rising," and yet, it has continued to rise steadily, until this week when rumors of Google being targeted by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">DOJ</a> surfaced and <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=goog>GOOG</a> dropped 8% in just two days.  The forever-climbing nature of Google's stock has made it a seemingly viable short-term investment, despite it's incredible price (nearly $480 at it's peak last week).  I think that this downturn will be the end, though, simply because it has had such massive gain over such a short period, it's just too volatile.

I went skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado over winter break and while there I climbed above all of the lifts to the summit of Peak 8, 13,000 feet up.  I just added the <a href="http://gallery.dinomite.net/gallery/v/Skiing/Breckenridge+2006">pictures</a> to my gallery.  Here's a picture of the Baldy (that may just be the local name), though it's hard to convey just how high up the peaks are.

It's only a few hundred yard hike to the summit since they put in the Imperial Express lift, but because I'm from sea level, it's a strenuous hike.  It's quite steep, and involves kicking your toes into the packed snow to ascend because it's so steep.

About a month ago a guy [started a site](http://windowsxp.onmac.net/The%20Contest.html) to collect donations and build a pool of money that would be given to the first person to get Windows XP runing on the new Intel-based Macs.  In the intervening time, some development progress has been made but overall it's been quite slow.  The hold up is that Windows has forever been designed to run on a machine with a standard BIOS that was designed way back when...  Basically, the Intel Macs initiate the boot process in a wholly different manner than all x86 PCs have previously.  This different booting strategy has been the real holdup in getting Windows to run on the otherwise fairly standard hardware and it looks like last week someone [got past that hurdle](http://windows.onmac.net/2006/02/21/the-windows-installer-loaded-on-an-imac/), booting into the Windows installer.  With that, I'd say we're nearing the time when Windows will run on Macs, a glorious day indeed.

I want to be able to pay for simple services on The Internets, say running a few searches on a subscription site, without having to shell out for their full subscription service.  Earlier today I wanted to look up some restaurants in Zagat's guide which, like everything these days, has interweb-searchability but, because they are a commercial entity, using said service requires having a subscription.  This is something where, right now at least, I don't want to sign up to use it for a month as I only want to run a couple of searches and paying $20 to use it for a day is a waste.  There should be some system by which I can pay per search or buy a short time period to access the site, worth less than a dollar.

Such payments, which are trivial to consumers who would barely think twice about paying for services all over the web once setup with the service, could net business like Zagat's online arm or Consumer Reports online searching functionality a significant amount of money.  There must be other people out there who have wanted to use a service for a short period, but don't care enough to sign up for a full subscription.

<p>Interesting point - to-date micropayments have not taken off on the web.  You should know, though, that you can purchase a 30-day subscription to zagat.com for only $3.95. So you can "buy a short time period to access the site" but not for less than a dollar.</p>

Though I like his books, I don't often listen to [Al Franken's radio show](http://shows.airamericaradio.com/alfrankenshow/); the show makes him seem more like a balance for Rush Limbaugh.  That's really an overstatement, because Franken isn't a psychotic drug addict who wants to kill people on the other side of the line, but Republicans these day seem to fit into the moderate (John McCain) or extreme (Rush Limbaugh, Tom DeLay, Ann Coulter, etc.) bins with little in between making it hard to find an analog for Franken.  Back to the point, though, I listened to The Al Franken show today (Monday's show via Autocast; the word podcast is a misnomer) and he had a funny bit, featuring a parody song entitled ["Hang on Stevens"](http://shows.airamericaradio.com/alfrankenshow/node/4154) admonishing the leftmost of the supreme court justices to not relinquish his seat on the bench until after the 2009 inauguration.

In other news, [Virtual Threads](http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com) posted an article yesterday about understanding Linux memory usage which was featured on Slashdot and Digg.  Today, he posted an [interesting map](http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com/2006/02/hello-world.html) of where his web hits came from.  Pretty cool to look at; I didn't realize there were so many technology inclined people in the central US.

[Sonic](http://www.sonicdrivein.com/index.jsp), the fast food chain self-proclaimed "America's Drive-in," which, I guess is true; it's the only drive in I know of this side of Oklahoma.  I'm not much for fast food, but I quite enjoy Sonic, probably only because of the novelty, as I only get it on my way to the Outer Banks, NC.  What confuses me is their advertising scheme.  The only place I've ever seen Sonic locations is in southern Virginia and beyond; indeed, the farthest north location on their website is in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Yet I see their television advertisments in D.C.  And in Rochester, fully 550 miles from Williamsburg.  Why do they advertise here, again?

I noticed a lot of network and forking activity while using my computer last week, thanks to [GKrellM](http://members.dslextreme.com/users/billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html)  I checked around and noticed a constant series of hits in my auth.log from someone trying common names to login via SSH.  I blocked the offender, but from looking through the log, this happened quite often and, though I have very strong passwords, this was very annoying to me to see all that crap in the logs.  I searched around and found a daemon called fail2ban that simply watches the logs and blocks hosts who have more than a specified number of failed login attempts.  It's in the Debian repositories, so just `apt-get install fail2ban` and then configure it in `/etc/fail2ban.conf`.

I also saw some cool tips on the [CLUG Wiki](http://wiki.clug.org.za/index.php/Defending_Against_Brute_Force_SSH_Attacks).

I'm not really a fan of Jay Leno, but this quote about the whole Cheney shooting incident was very, very good; kudos to his writers.

"What a nightmare I had last night. I dreamed I was at a Washington party and I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home." --Jay Leno

This came from a page with a list of [jokes made about Cheney](http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blcheneyquotes.htm) since back in the first term.  It also links to a couple of great clips from The Daily Show on shooting:

* [Dick Cheney shoots friend while hunting](http://movies.crooksandliars.com/TDS-Cheney-Shotg.mov)
* [Downgrading the funniness because Whittington had a heart attack](http://movies.crooksandliars.com/com_tds_cheney_s.mov)

BODY:
<p>Port scanning is a method of finding listening services (open ports) on a
computer.  In laymen's terms, port scanning is akin to checking if doors and
windows are unlocked on a house.  It is useful for locating vulnerable computers
on a network for security auditing purposes as well as attacking them.

<img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/images/TCP.bmp' alt='TCP diagram' align='right' />

</p><p>To understand port scanning, you first must know how the TCP protocol works.
TCP is called a connection oriented protocol, as it initiates a connection
between two machines when they want to transfer data.  This is compared to
connectionless protocols, like UDP, which don't initiate connections or gurantee
delivery of data.  To begin a connection, the client sends a packet to the
server with the SYN flag set which tells the server it wants to initiate a
connection and where to start numbering packets.  The server responds with a
packet that has the SYN and ACK flags set, acknowleding the connection.  The
client then completes the setup of the connection by responding with a packet
having the ACK flag set.  After this point, the client and server can
communicate as a stream, sending all the data they wish.  When they have
completed sending all of their data, the connection is terminated when one of
them sends a FIN/ACK packet and the other responds with an ACK.

</p><p>Now that we've covered the basics of TCP, we can move on to Nmap itself.
Nmap is a featureful port scanner supporting all of the popular scanning
mechanisms including TCP connect(), SYN, FIN, Xmas and null scans.  In addition,
Nmap supports ping sweeping, operating system detection, decoy and zombie hosts.

</p><p>The TCP connect() scan is the simplest and Nmap's default.  All it does is
check each port on the target machine by initiating a connection using the
operating system's connect() call.  Being that it only utilizes standard system
calls available to normal users, this type of scan does not require root or
administrator priveleges.  However, the connect() is easily detected because it
is fairly noisy; the port scanner must fully initiate a connection with each
port that it finds open.

</p><p>A SYN scan, also knowsn as a half-open scan, only sends the first packet of a
connection initiate, the SYN packet.  It never attempts to complete the
connection, rather it simply listens for the response of the target.  If it
replies with a SYN/ACK packet, the port is in listening mode.  If it responds
with a RST/ACK, the port is closed.  The SYN scan is considered to be a stealth
scan, as the connection is never completed and therefore never registered with
any listening services.  Most modern firewalls and monitoring systems can detect
SYN scans, however.

</p><p>FIN, Xmas tree and null scans all work in the same manner.  The port scanner
sends a packet to the target machine out of the blue, which doesn't make sense
out of the context of a connection.  RFC 793 stipulates that closed ports should
respond to this probe with a RST whilst open ports will ignore it.  Unfortunately, this doesn't
work against Microsoft operating systems because they don't comply to the standard,
ignoring such packets instead.

</p><p>Because of their nature, attempting to connect to numerous ports on a
computer, port scans can usually be detected quite easily.  Most port scanners
will scan in a random order, so that their activities aren't blatantly obvious,
 but the speed and manner with which they scan is usually still easily detected.
 Many firewalls have options to detect and slow or prevent port scans.  Linux's
 current kernel-based firewall, Netfilter (IPChains) has a number of rules that
 can do this, such as rules to limit port connections over a time period.
 There are also more advanced programs, like <a href="http://www.snort.org">snort</a> and <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad">Port Scan Attack Detector (PSAD)</a>
 which can monitor for port scans, notify you of them and take action (blocking
 the scanning hosts) to prevent such scans.</p>

BODY:
<p>This is the outline to a seminar that I gave at <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu">CSH</a> on filesystems.  The impetus was simply my lack of knowledge for how filesystems work and the misconceptions (particularly about journaling) that most people have.  Synopsis: use ReiserFS, but don't believe the <a href="http://funroll-loops.org">Gentoo kiddies</a> who say you'll get a massive performance boost; you wont.  ReiserFS is slightly faster than EXT3, a little bit more space efficient and gets beyond the 2GB filesize limit.  I run EXT2 because  it's a touche faster than all the journaling filesystems and I know that my systems aren't going to go down uncleanly.  Most people, however, aren't as meticulous as I am so a Journaling filesystem is a better fit.

I wrote this script because I wanted to be able to make a playlist and give give a friend the associated files for said playlist.  To start, use Bery's script from above and export a playlist.  Then grab [my script](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/attic/playlist.txt) and run it, passing the name of the M3U file that you just created.  My script will create a directory in the same place as the M3U that you passed to it, fill that with the MP3s from said playlist, and create a new M3U for the directory.</username>

Installing an X brace is easy, cheap as far as mods go and provides noticeable benefit to your E36's handling. I got my X Brace from Circle BMW in New Jersey. You can mail order from them, as I did, or get it from your local dealer. Circle BMW and Pacific BMW are usually the cheapest prices around.

This is not the only how-to on the web, as you have may have already found. Check out Understeer's picture-filled how-to for cars that don't have nutserts (1995 and early 1996).

**Parts required**

* X Brace
* 4x BMW M8 bolts

**Tools required**

* 13mm wrench/socket
* 16mm wrench/socket
* ramps or a floor jack and jackstands
* Lock-Tite

I wish I had pictures of the X brace install, but it's so easy it should be understandable through writing. I installed it on two cars in less than an hour using nothing than the tools listed above.  Note that you don't even need jack stands to do this. With the car on ramps, slide under until you are looking at the bellhousing (where the transmission meets the engine). There will be a bar going laterally across the car in that area which will be replaced by the X brace. The bolts holding this bar in place are just like many others on an e36, 16mm. Take out the two bolts, remove the bar and put the X brace in it's place, which should come with your new X brace.  It's a good idea to use Lock-Tite on all of these bolts.

You're done! I took the long route to 7 Eleven and got a 52oz. Slurpee. You might test differently.  However you choose to celebrate, remember to brake late, accelerate hard and test the horn.

BODY:
The new rules for the 2006 Formula 1 season were released earlier this month and they make some pretty big changes, mostly in the name of reducing the cost to participating teams.  In addition to the new 2.4-liter V8 engines, which are rev-limited to 19,000 rpm, the FIA has said that they will review bodywork to reduce downforce whilst maintain drag levels.  In this same vein of increacing reliance on mechanical grip, tire sizes have been increased and slick tires are back.  One of the big questions from last year was whtether F1 would continue to have two tire manufacturers and it looks like all of the cars will be on Bridgestones next year.  Cars will continue to have only a single set of tires for the race and in addition to three-weekend engines, transmissions will have to last four events.

Of the more obvious cost-cutting measures was the reduction of the minimum weight from 590 to 550 kilograms (1300 to 1212 pounds).  The reason for this is that all of the cars in the series have been *well* under the former limit and to reach the minimum used expensive tungsten, chosen for it's very high density.  As always, the astonishing thing about these number is that a standard small passenger car is just shy of 3000 pounds and yet produces less than one quarter of the horsepower of a Formula 1 car.

I became quite well versed in the low-level operation of most filesystems, EXT, UFS and Reiser in particular. I didn't realize until I was actually speaking to other people about filesystems how boring and monotonous they are.

The printed version didn't work very well, my version is a lot faster and some other stuff that I don't remember. It's well commented, interesting to look at if you like networking.  It can find all webservers on the given subnet.

<h1>Compiling the Darwin Kernel</h1>

I'm writing this how-to beause when I wanted to enable MAC address spoofing on my Powerbook, it was a little bit more of an adventure than I had hoped for.  I had to look through a number of different tutorials, picking and choosing what I knew from my experience with Mac OSX and Linux/BSD to be correct; there are a number of conflicting directions in other tutorials.  Hopefully mine makes sense the whole way through.

<h2>Prepare the Build Environment</h2>

To build a Mach kernel you need a number of things, namely, XCode, bootstrap_cmds, Libstreams, cctools, kext-tools, IOKitUser and xnu.  The former is included on any new Mac (run the "Developer Tools" installer in the Applications folder) and the latter must be obtained from the Apple developers site, which requires a (free) membership login.

1. Assuming you have XCode installed, the first thing to do is grab the packages that you'll need for building the kernel.  They can be obtained from the abovementioned location, <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl</a>.  You'll need the following packages:
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/bootstrap_cmds-44.tar.gz">bootstrap_cmds</a>
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/Libstreams-23.tar.gz">Libstreams</a>
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/cctools-525.tar.gz">cctools</a>
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/kext_tools-42.tar.gz">kext-tools</a>
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/IOKitUser-184.tar.gz">IOKitUser</a>
 - <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/xnu-517.11.1.tar.gz">xnu</a>
Just grab those packages (get the latest versions) and toss them into a directory where we can work.  I used /usr/local/src.

2. Untar all of those packages:  <pre># cd /usr/local/src; for i in $(ls); do tar zxvf $i; done</pre>  Whew, that was tough.  Go make a sandwich before continuing.

3. Let's build what we need in `bootstrap_cmds` and `Libstreams`, because they're easy.
<br />**Note**: I'm performing all of these commands as root, which isn't enabled be default on Mac OS X (I think).  Most people will probably more comfortable with untarring/building all of these things in their own userspace (say, your home directory) and then using sudo when you need to be root.  I come from Linux, where _Real Men_ use su.
<br />`# cd bootstrap_cmds-*/relpath.tproj`
<br />`# make`
<br />`# make install`
<br />Now, Libstreams:
<br />`# cd ../../Libstreams-*`
<br />`# make`
<br />`# make install`

4. Time to build cctools, it's a little bit more involved.
<br />`# cd ../cctools-*`
<br />`# cp /usr/include/sys/unistd.h /System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Headers/sys/`
We only care about some of what cctools has to offer, so bust open it's `Makefile` and lets edit it a little.  We're going to comment out the two lines (28 and 29) that define `COMMON_SUBDIRS` and redefine it as` COMMON_SUBDIRS = libstuff libmacho misc`.
<br />`#COMMON_SUBDIRS = libstuff as gprof misc libmacho ld libdyld \`
<br />`#                mkshlib otool profileServer RelNotes man cbtlibs`
<br />`COMMON_SUBDIRS = libstuff libmacho misc`
That's what it should look like when you're done, at which point you're ready to build and install it.
<br />`# make RC_OS=macos`
<br />`# cp misc/seg_hack.NEW /usr/local/bin/seg_hack`
<br />`# cd ld`
<br />`# make RC_OS=macos kld_build`
<br />`# cp static_kld/libkld.a /usr/local/lib`
<br />`# ranlib /usr/local/lib/libkld.a`

5. Compiling kextsymboltool is where I ran into trouble, well, because I grabbed the wrong IOKit version (I didn't have the newest one), so watch out for that.  If you get the right version, everything should go smoothly.
<br />`# cd ../../`
<br />`# mv IOKitUser* IOKit`
<br />`# mv IOKit /usr/include`
<br />`# mv /usr/include/IOKit/kext.subproj /usr/include/IOKit/kext`
<br />`# cp -fpr cctools*/include/mach-o /usr/include`
<br />`# cp -fpr cctools*/include/mach/* /usr/include/mach`
<br />`# cd kext_tools*`
<br />`# gcc kextsymboltool.c -o kextsymboltool`
<br />`# cp kextsymboltool /usr/local/bin`
<br />`# chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/kextsymboltool`

__Done!__  Well, sort of.  The build environment is all set up, so now if you ever want to build a new kernel, you can start on the next step.


<h2>Building the Kernel</h2>

1. The first thing to do is apply any patches that you desire.  You'll probably be adding some patches; otherwise, why would you be rebuilding the kernel?  I'm using a patch to enable setting the MAC address of my network cards manually (for MAC address spoofing), one that boots my mac in verbose mode by default and a third that allows all users (not just root) to craft and send raw packets.  They are available from the following locations (the direct links are for xnu version 517):
 - <a href="http://cerberus.sourcefire.com/~jeff/archives/patches/macosx/BIOCSHDRCMPLT-panther.patch">BIOCSHDRCMPLT</a> - MAC address patch by <a href="http://cerberus.sourcefire.com/%7Ejeff/security.html">Jeff Nathan</a>
 - <a href="http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/517/FORCE_VERBOSE.patch">FORCE_VERBOSE</a> - Verbose booting patch by <a href="http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/">Peter Bartoli</a>
 - <a href="http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/517/RAW4ALL.patch">RAW4ALL</a> - Raw packet creation patch also by <a href="http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/">Peter Bartoli</a>
<br />To begin with, let's move to the kernel source directory:
<br />`# cd ../xnu*`
<br />Grab the three patches:
<br />`# wget http://cerberus.sourcefire.com/%7Ejeff/archives/patches/macosx/BIOCSHDRCMPLT-10.3.3.patch`
<br />`# wget http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/517/FORCE_VERBOSE.patch`
<br />`# wget http://slagheap.net/etherspoof/517/RAW4ALL.patch`
<br />and patch the kernel source:
<br />`# patch -p0 -b --verbose --suffix=.orig < RAW4ALL.patch`
<br />`# patch -p0 -b --verbose --suffix=.orig < FORCE_VERBOSE.patch`
<br />`# patch -p0 -b --verbose --suffix=.orig < BIOCHSHDRCMPLT-10.3.3.patch`
Pay attention to the output of those patches; if the source changes significantly from the time I wrote this page, they might not apply properly.  If they work fine, you can move on.

2. Finally, we will actually build the kernel:
<br />`# make exporthdrs`
<br />`# make`
<br />The new kernel is now in `BUILD/obj/RELEASE_PPC/mach_kernel` under the current directory.  Next, we'll install and prepare to boot with the new kernel.

3. To install, just copy the new kernel to the root (/) directory.  We'll name it differently from the stock kernel, so that you have something to fall back on if your new kernel fails to boot properly.
<br />`# cp BUILD/obj/RELEASE_PPC/mach_kernel /mach_kernel.new`
<br />`# chmod 644 /mach_kernel.new`
<br />`# chown root.wheel /mach_kernel.new`
<br />Now configure the machine to boot from the new kernel:

<br />`# nvram boot-file=\`nvram boot-device | awk -F , '{print $1}' | awk '{print $2}'\`,mach_kernel.new`

**Note**: That is supposed to work, but really, didn't for me.  I had  to make a leap-of-faith and replace the stock kernel with the one that I just built.
<br />`# cp mach_kernel mach_kernel.bak`
<br />`# cp mach_kernel.new mach_kernel`
<br />`# nvram boot-file=""`

You should be all set!  Upon reboot, the computer should boot with your new kernel.  In the event something goes wrong, you can zap the PRAM by holding
option-apple-p-r through <b>three</b> startup chimes.  Alternatively, hold option-apple-o-f which will boot into OpenFirmware; type "reset-all" and then "mac-boot".  If neither of those fixes the problem, hold option-apple-n-v during boot to reset the NVRAM.

Bombay changed it's name to [Mumbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) more than 10 years ago yet news stories concerning the city on the Western coast of India usually still reference the name under British rule.  Surely this most populous city in the country and one of the largest in the world has enough cachet that we can all recognize it's name without being prompted by the past.  The Indians are already well on their way to being an econmic powerhouse after all and Mumbai is the center of this emerging market.

Though about a year and a half old, [this is a very good article](http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html) (and presentation; scroll down) about the positive effect that piracy can have.  Written by [Mark Pesce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pesce), this is a case study of how <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>'s distribution via BitTorrent changed the viewership of that show; bringing it to Americans before the scheduled release and to Australia where it wasn't set to be available at all.  Further, he goes on to explore the ways that advertisers can still profit from this model that cuts out television networks who normally marry shows with advertisements.

We now live in a time where many people (myself included) don't know or care when the shows they want to watch are broadcast or what channel they are one.  If you simply get your TV from the internet, the channel and time simply don't matter. Nor do the advertisements, which are normally snipped from interweb-released shows.  Are we soon to see TV funded by product placement, layover placards and bugs?

A friend made me a CD a few weeks ago and included a sublime rendition of <i>Somewhere Over the Rainbow</i> and <i>What a Wonderful World</i>, but he didn't know who the artist was.  I heard the same song on a commercial for Rice Krispies today while watching CNN.  I quickly went to my computer and used Google to dispatch a query through the tubes of The Internet which led me to [this Yahoo! Answers page](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061003162121AADpJlo) that solved the mystery.  Apparently the song was also featured in <i>[50 First Dates](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343660/)</i>.

The song is by [Israel Kamakawiwo'ole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Kamakawiwo%27ole), who is certainly not who you'd expect if you hear the very ethereal nature of his rendition.  Iz, made numerous albums in the style of his native Hawaii often advocating Hawaiian independence.  His music features a lot of ukulele, much like [Jake Shimabukuro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Shimabukuro), who has also grabbed my interest recently.

My MythTV installation hasn't been working for a couple of weeks and I hadn't gotten around to fixing it until today; shows you how much TV matters to me when I'm busy.  It was a really easy error to fix - simply a crashed table which was quick to diagnose and fix even though I hadn't ever encountered anything of the sort before.  For Google-searchers, the error from mythbackend was as follows:

<code><pre>
&lt;snip&gt;
2006-11-28 17:38:35.805 DB Error (UpdateMatches):
Query was:
DELETE FROM program WHERE manualid = -1 OR  (manualid <> 0 AND -1 = -1)
Driver error was [2/145]:
QMYSQL3: Unable to execute query
Database error was:
Table './mythconverg/program' is marked as crashed and should be repaired
&lt;/snip&gt;
</pre></code>

To fix it, I simply had to login to the database, 'use mythconverg;', and issue the command 'repair table program;'.  As noted below, make sure you see those semicolons.  Simple.

<p>yeah, the "repair table" thing works, but this almost happens to my DB every day - and it's not much fun. Havn't found a solution for it yet. only thing i can think of is a cron-job that repairs the crashed tables... But don't like that solution. Something is probably causing MySQL to crash... but what?</p>

This week and last, news outlets have mentioned the [rising price of tortillas](http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/business/article/0,1426,MCA_440_5278441,00.html) in Mexico.  It seems humorous on the surface but tortillas are the staple food of Mexico's poor and the 14% increase in prices for the commodity in the past year, as compared to the country's 4% inflation, is significant for many.  Tortillas have increased in price because the white corn from which they are made has similarly increased in value due in part to the increased demand for yellow corn that is used to make ethanol.

One of the authors of Freaknomics, Stephen Dubner, recently [mentioned in his blog](http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/10/will-the-high-price-of-oil-make-americans-skinnier/) that these increase in corn prices stem from the high price of oil, which bolsters demand for ethanol.  Anyone who has read <em>The Omnivore's Dillema</em> knows that corn is the basis for nearly all industrially produced food in the United States.  Could Dubner be right that this oil prices could lead to less obese Americans through a convoluted chain of corn?

If you watched the speech in high-def (wider and more detailed coverage!) then this was pretty obvious throughout the entire speech.

On a somewhat unrelated note, an NPR analyst described the war in Iraq as a [morass](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=morass&x=0&y=0), which I think is a very appropriate way to characterize the situation.

BODY:
In the State of the Union last night, Bush proposed a way to the way health care is taxed.  This announcement was something of a surprise -- the first I heard of it was Monday morning.  It sounds sort of complicated, but once all laid out, it's fairly straightforward.  Currently, if you get health insurance from your employer you don't pay any tax on the cost of the plan.  Similarly, those who are self-employed can deduct the cost of their health insurance from their taxable income.  Anyone who pays their own health insurance outright, either because their employer doesn't offer it or they can't qualify for the plans that their employer offers, pay that expense after tax.

Under Bush's new plan, that last group would be allowed to deduct their health insurance cost.  The loss in tax revenue would come from a change to the taxation of those in the employer-paid insurance group; their insurance payments would be taxed if they exceed $15,000 for a family or $7,500 for an individual.  If your annual healthcare premiums are less than those limits, you would see no change and it would still be tax free.  The idea here is that this change covers the lost tax revenue while at the same time discouraging employers from offering overly-generous healthcare coverage and encourage the creation of low-cost plans that don't currently exist.

I just picked up <strong>The God Delusion</strong> by Richard Dawkins, a book which I'm sure contains numerous interesting quotes.  The first chapter focuses on the undue respect afforded to religious beliefs.  Dawkins makes the point that, though people can openly argue about politics, economics and warfare, religion gets a pass.  Arguing about religion is a way to bring up undue hatred from anyone whose views differ.  In concluding the chapter he quotes [H. L. Mencken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken) who said, "We must respect the other fellow's religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart."  A fitting summarization.

BODY:
When you build kernel modules or other programs that depend upon the kernel you need to have the kernel source configured per the currently running kernel.  To see what kernel your machine is running, simply run `uname -a`.  To setup your machine to allow things to build against the kernel, you first need the source for your currently running kernel:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
export KERNEL_VERSION=`uname -r|cut -d '-' -f 1`
sudo aptitude install linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION
cd /usr/src/
sudo tar jxf linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION.tar.bz2
sudo ln -s linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION linux
ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
</pre>

First, in order to get things to build against the kernel you have to alter a single file to match the kernel you're running.  Run `uname -r` and note everything following the first three decimal-separated numbers:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
$ uname -r
2.6.17-10-386
</pre>

Just use a text editor (vi!) and edit ` /usr/src/linux/Makefile`, changing the `EXTRAVERSION` variable to match yours from above:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 17
#EXTRAVERSION = .14-ubuntu1
EXTRAVERSION = -10-386
NAME=Crazed Snow-Weasel
</pre>

Next, you need to get the .config for the running kernel and setup the kernel source:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
sudo cp /boot/config-`uname -r` /usr/src/linux/.config
cd /usr/src/linux
make oldconfig
make prepare0
make scripts
</pre>

That's it.  Now you should be able to build things, like kernel modules, against the kernel source.

BODY:
I installed Azureus on my Ubuntu machine recently and found it to absolutely *peg* the CPU when downloading more than a few torrents at once.  I know that Bittorrent is a pretty CPU intensive protocol, but I had been running similar numbers of torrents on the same machine using [bittornado](http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/net/bittornado) with much less ado.  By default, Ubuntu installs the [GCJ Java virtual machine](http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/interpreters/java-gcj-compat), which is a perfectly serviceable JVM, but I suspected it wasn't as good as Sun's own.  I'll shall not decree that Sun's JVM is better than GCJ, as I didn't actually run any tests, but Azureus runs faster now that I'm using the Sun machine.  Onward.

Overall this is a pretty simple install. First, because of how Sun's JVM is licensed, you need to manually download it from [the Sun site](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp).  If you plan on compiling Java code, get the Java Development Kit (JDK); if you don't write software, you can just get the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  Either way, make sure you get the vanilla package, not the RPM (RedHat package).

Once you have that, you need to install `java-package` using apt-get.  You will first need to change two lines in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, adding `universe` and `multiverse` as is shown below:

<code>
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted <b>universe multiverse</b><br />
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted <b>universe multiverse</b>
</code>

Open a terminal and type this in, answering "yes" to any questions the program asks:

`sudo apt-get install java-package`

Now, you just need to make a .deb out of Sun's Java package that you grabbed.  In the same terminal, change to the directory where said package resides and run the following, once again choosing happy answers like 'y' and 'yes' when you are presented with quesions:

`chmod +x *.bin; fakeroot make-jpkg *.bin; sudo dpkg -i sun-j2sdk*.deb`

Easy as that.  To make this the default JVM simply run the following command:

`sudo update-java-alternatives --config java`

BODY:
I'm doing a project on MD5 collisions for my parallel computing class and, like all cryptography, the code involves a lot of hex numbers (in standard notation, 0xf00d, 0xbeef, etc.) which naturaly makes parts of the code difficult to read.  That's simply the nature of [the algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Algorithm).  Some programmers (often just mathematicians) insist on making the code even more illedgible with things like this:

<code>while (counter < (1 << 9))</code>

The bigger problem is that when I see something like that I'm confused; I am both impressed by their cleverness (that loops while counter is less than 512) but also annoyed by their needless obfuscation.  I guess one could argue that a left shift is more ledgible, because if it were a number larger than 10 or so, people wouldn't know the significance.  Who really knows of the top of their head that 262144 is 2^18?  So, in the end, it's not necessarily just obfuscation but really, most programmers will recognize at least up to 2^10 and those who know the internets should know 2^16 as well.

As I read more about cryptography (I'm currently making my way through the great tome, [Applied Cryptography](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471117099/sr=8-1/qid=1145849010/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8)) I've been thinking more about random number generators.  Whenever you read about cryptography or how they build slot machines (Kevin Mitnick covers this in [The Art of Intrusion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764569597/sr=8-1/qid=1145849136/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6924799-8398511?%5Fencoding=UTF8)) there is talk of how bad computer random number generators are, particularly the standard functions that are part of Java, libc or .NET.  Even if you take the time to seed them, the pseudo-randomness is of quite low quality.  I just found an article on some [random number generators you can implement yourself](http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/random_number_generation).  Cool.

I'm not really a fan of Jay Leno, but this quote about the whole Cheney shooting incident was very, very good; kudos to his writers.

"What a nightmare I had last night. I dreamed I was at a Washington party and I had to choose between Dick Cheney taking me on a hunting trip or Ted Kennedy driving me home." --Jay Leno

This came from a page with a list of [jokes made about Cheney](http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blcheneyquotes.htm) since back in the first term.  It also links to a couple of great clips from The Daily Show on shooting:

* [Dick Cheney shoots friend while hunting](http://movies.crooksandliars.com/TDS-Cheney-Shotg.mov)

Intel's latest big chip, the Pentium Extreme Edition 965, costs just over a thousand dollars and yet it still [looses out](http://www.techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/pentium-xe-965/index.x?pg=4) to the AMD's not-quite-top-of-their-line Athlon 64 X2 4800+ which can be had for around $650 (the Athlon 64 FX-60 is their range-topper).  The biggest discrepencies are seen in gaming benchmarks, which is particularly sad because gamers are the biggest market for such hugely expensive chips.

In short, Intel's [NetBurst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBurst) architecture still sucks; for their sake, I hope [Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_Microarchitecture) is as fast as they purport.  Until then, as the state has been for the past few years, buy AMD.

So, I'm pretty high in [self-efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy); I am very confident in my own abilities and my aptitude for learning new skills and information.  I look at things like [WRC](http://www.wrc.com) or [Formula 1](http://www.formula1.com) and think, "With some practice, I could definitely do that," which is my assesment of most things I come across.  Overconfident isn't a far off descriptor for me at times.  Occasionally, though, something comes along that totally shatters my belief in my own skills and simply leaves me in awe of someone's knowledge or talents, such as this video of a guy [performing a choreographed juggling routing with 5 balls](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6283096511750618839).  Seeing this video left me speechless and I have immense respect for that guy.  When you break it down, those are all moves that, with some practice, most people could be taught to do.  Stringing them together into a 5 minute routine choreographed to music without a single dropped ball is entirely another story.  Wow.

Edit: So apparently the guy is [Jason Garfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garfield), a professional juggler.  Given that juggling is his occupation, it's a lot more understandable; I'm still amazed at his skill.

I've been reading [Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007162219/sr=8-1/qid=1144684215/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8438297-9319959?%5Fencoding=UTF8) by Simon Singh, an excellent history of all cosmology.  The book starts with the very beginning of astronomical exploration, such as Eratosthenes who was the first to estimate the Earth's diameter.  I'm nearing the end of the book (the mid 1900's, shortly after the Big Bang theory was created) and ran across this, [George Gamow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow)'s version of the bible's Genesis:

<blockquote>
In the beginning God created Radiation and Ylem. And the Ylem was without shape or number, and the nucleons were rushing madly upon the face of the deep.
<br><br>
And God said: "Let there be mass two." And there was mass two. And God saw deuterium, and it was good.
<br><br>
And God said: "Let there be mass three." And there was mass three. And God saw tritium, and it was good.
<br><br>
And God continued to call numbers until He came to the transuranium elements. But when He looked back on his work, He saw that it was not good. In the excitement of counting, He had missed calling for mass five, and so, naturally, no heavier elements could have been formed.
<br><br>
God was very disappointed by that slip and wanted to contract the universe again and start everything from the beginning. But that would be much too simple. Instead, being Almighty, God decided to make heavy elements in the most impossible way.
<br><br>
And so God said: "Let there be Hoyle." And there was Hoyle. And God saw Hoyle and told him to make heavy elements in any way he pleased.
<br><br>
And so Hoyle decided to make heavy elements in stars, and to spread them around by means of supernova explosions. But in doing so, Hoyle had to follow the blueprint of abundances which God prepared earlier when He had planned to make the elements from Ylem.
<br><br>
Thus, with the help of God, Hoyle made all heavy elements in stars, but it was so complicated that neither Hoyle, nor God, nor anybody else can now figure out exactly how it was done.

I bought a Shuttle SB86i a few months ago, which is an Intel based small form factor system ([reviewed by Silent PC Review](http://www.silentpcreview.com/article230-page1.html)) which came with an on-board gigabit ethernet adapter.  This piece is referred to by <code>lspci</code> as a "Marvell Technology Groupl Ltd. 88E8053 Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)" and by <code>dmesg</code> as a "Yukon Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter".  Either way, the chipset is made by SysKonnect and the driver in the kernel tree (sk98lin) just plain doesn't work.  A quick search  (via Google, what else?) turned up [this post](http://www.grad.name/blog/2006/01/28/marvell-gigabit-on-linux/) which referenced [SysKonnect's driver page](http://www.skd.de/e_en/support/driver.html).  Fromt the driver page (I chose the 'SK-9E21D 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter' under 'PCI Express Desktop Adapter') I was able to get their very simple package to build the kernel module on my Ubuntu system, all you need are the compiled kernel sources for the kernel you're running.  If you don't know anything about your kernel and you're running Ubuntu (Dapper Drake, probably others), run this command as root to get and compile the kernel sources:

<pre><code>
~# KERNEL_VERSION=`uname -r|grep -o "2\.[4|6]\.[1|2|][0-9]"` &&\
 apt-get install linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION &&\
 cd /usr/src && /bin/tar jxf linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION.tar.bz2 &&\
 ln -s linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION linux &&\
 cd linux-source-$KERNEL_VERSION &&\
 cp /boot/config-$KERNEL_VERSION-* .config &&\
 make oldconfig && make
</code></pre>

...and then install the driver from SysKonnect.  If you don't know what the above comman does, pick it apart and figure it out!  That's what Linux is all about.
(cool regex, eh?)

News to me: you can use The Internet from planes now; I knew that this was in the works, but I didn't think it had actually been implemented yet.  Apparently Lufthansa (others?) has WiFi planes that communicate with the outside world via satellite links.  As is thoroughly explained in [this post](http://www.renesys.com/blog/2006/04/tracking_plane_flight_on_inter.shtml), the plane connects to a geostationary satellite and has it's own /24 network.  The planes intelligently decide which satellite to use based upon which will produce shorter routing at the ground station and are able to dynamically change this throughout the flight.  As the Renesys blogger shows, the planes announce their route changes thus allowing graceful switches amongst the satellites.  Cool.

[This presentation](http://www.nanog.org/mtg-0405/abarbanel.html) explains the system that Boeing developed.

<p>Lufthansa is currently the only airline that provides in-flight WiFi, I think they started offering it about a year ago. The pricing scheme seems a little pricey - $27 per flight? wtf. The system they developed is quite clever, nevertheless. I bet the next airline to start providing WiFi is EOS Airlines..</p>

<p>I have a question. I think that is very interesting the system that Boeing developed but I cant understand a question. If a plane is connected with the AS1 when the plane change to AS3, I think the connexion BGP is lost, because BGP is over TCP and the connexion TCP I think that is lost. Is it true? I cant understand how it works this service.
Thanks</p>

<p>As I understand it, all of the plane's connections are indeed dropped when the route switchover occurs.  As the plane crosses the midpoint between the two satellite links, the BGP session is brought down, withdrawn by the routers on the origin side and then brought up and advertised on the destination side.</p>

<p>Yes, any active connections will be dropped and must be re-negotiated.  If you were casually browsing the web (and actually reading the pages), you might not even notice, since the interruption is so short.</p>

One of the most oft encountered logical fallacies, particularly when quoting the outcome of studies or statistics, is that of confusing correlation of variables with causation; [**cum hoc ergo propter hoc**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29) (latin, *with this, therefore, because of this*).  This fallacy is the root of irrational beliefs, fears and biases in otherwise intelligent and informed people.

This came to light earlier this week in a forum where some people who would generally not be considered bigoted where having a "truthful" discussion about whay they thought of black people.  Statistics, such as the rate of black men being incarcerated vs. that for white men, were quoted and the crowd all pointed saying, "See, they're more likely to go to jail; the stastics don't lie, they're just bad people."  This was from a bunch of people who don't want to be racist, but they found it troubling to agree with the statistics, which are true, agree with their own experiences (bad neighborhoods == black neighborhoods) and yet not see blacks as being inherently predisposed to crime.

The root of their misunderstanding lies in the logical fallacy of assuming that correlation proves causation.  The most important thing to realize when reading studies or statistics is that the correlation of two variables does not mean that they are anything but related.  I recently read of a study done by the US Army which found that the best predictor of whether or not someone would ever be involved in a motorcycle accident was the number of tattoos they had.  Does that mean that tatoos cause motorcycle accidents or cause poeple to be stupid?  No.  All it means is that people with lots of tattoos tend to have motorcycles and ride them more than those without.  Perhaps the root cause is that they're more inclined to take risk, but quite obviously, tattoos don't cause motorcycle riders to crash.

To get a better understanding of how to interpret studies, I highly recommend reading *Freakonomics* by Steven Levitt.  His book examines a number of different situations and a huge amount of data using techniques like regression analysis to find the root causes in otherwise random data.  For the race problem, it basically boils down to the fact that criminal tendencies are not well correlated with race but rather with low education and low income.  Drawing on that, it's quite easy to understand how blacks are still associated with being criminals and easy to see just how long it is going to take for the remanants of a racist society to be removed from our civilization.

Ever drive behind an ambulance and notice the chains hanging from the rear axel?  I've always wondered what those were for and today listening to CarTalk they suggested to a guy who was complaining about being shocked by his car to use a ground strap or chains that would drag on the ground to...ground the car.  For ambulances, I would bet that being at ground potential is importand for their instruments (EKG?) or perhaps they just don't want to shock people.  Interesting.

They are called On Spot Chains. They are used for slippery conditions, mainly in snow and mud. They are dropped by a switch on the dashboard inside the vehicle. They add traction by roughing up the surface underneath and around the rear tires.

My social psychology teach counseled his students in the great benefit that goals can have on mood, [self-esteem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem) and [self-efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy), the latter being much more important in light of recent studies.  Accomplishing goals, however small, has a great positive effect upon one's feelings of self worth (self-esteem), motivation and ability to achieve (self-efficacy).  In this light, he implored everyone to create to-do lists every day, outlining everything you plan to do.

Really, you want to include as much as possible, within reason.  Something like "get out of bed" probably doesn't belong on a list, but "go to the gym" is a good goal.  If you see breakfast as standard fare, it doesn't need to be on the list, but if you're one to normally skip the day's prime meal and want to change, it ought ot be on your list.  As silly as some goals seem, even eating breakfast, achieving a goal has great positive psychological effects, as mentioned above.  Be warned however, that failing to achieve a goal has inverse effects.  In that light, creating goals that aren't trivial but at the same time aren't too much of a stretch is the best thing to do.

Furthermore, having a list of huge goals that are very long in the making should be somewhere else; putting "build kit car" on your daily list won't do anything good but keep that un-achieved objective present in memory.  If you are building a kit car, perhaps you want to get the bottom end assembled this weekend or install a couple of control arms today.

Unsurprisingly showing your receipt to the goon at the door and letting him inspect your purchase is entirely optional, from a legal standpoint.  The store's only powers to detain you are if they suspect you of shoplifting which requires that they:

1. Have seen someone approach, take, and conceal the merchandise
2. Observe the shoplifter continuously
3. Verify that they fail to pay for it
4. Apprehend the shoplifter outside the store.

The guy at the door can't possibly do all of this; he's stationed by the door and, assumedly, doesn't leave his post.  After reading these stories, I'm inclined to test these systems every chance I get; it'll be an interesting day the first time I'm accosted as a shoplifter.

BODY:
Undoubtedly, the most comprehensive map to electronic music is [Ishkur's Guide](http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html) which covers every genre, even reaching out to Rap, much of which contains electronic elements.  Ishkur's Guide is certainly worth perusing if you're interested in electronic music, but is a bit cumbersome for someone simply looking for an overview.  The best way to get a quick understanding of the different genres within electronic music is to hear the same song presented through different interpretations.  Madonna's [<em>Like a Prayer</em>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_%28song%29) fits this bill nicely, as it has been remixed by numerous artists in a myriad of styles.

[The original](http://dinomite.net/static/music/madonna-like-a-prayer-original.mp3) version of the song is a pop-styled electronic-backed vocal ensemble with a number of distinct elements.  Taking note of the song's components is important to understanding which parts the remixes keep, which they alter and what from the song is tossed out completely.  The archetype begins with an odd riff from a guitar that isn't heard anywhere else in the song, nor in any remixes; such introductions are often thrown to the wayside when songs are remixed.  From there, the song progresses with an ethereal chorus backing Madonna's airy and LOVING vocals which sets the mood.  From there, the an 80's electric bass and drum set are added, which come and go throughout the balance of the tune.  As you will hear in the remixes all of the elements of the song will be subject to change.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-house-mix.mp3">Mad'House'smix</a></li>
</ul>
First is a version by [Mad'House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad'House), a short-lived ensemble which <em>only</em> made remixes of Madonna songs.  I would describe this mix as having a [house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) feel, which is certainly in keeping the the group's intentions.  It adds a harder base beat, electronic bass kicks and replaces Madonna's vocals with those of Buse Ünlü, the group's vocalist.  This track keeps true to the feeling of the original, while forgoing the instrumentation in pop princess' version entirely.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-club-mix.mp3">DJ M bbe's club mix</a></li>
</ul>
Break out your subwoofer, because the club mix is here.  Club music is, hence the name, intended for dance clubs, which accounts for the overpowering bass kick.  Beyond Mad'House's mix, this track brings the aforementioned bass beat, more heavily altered vocals and transforms the choir to make them sound much more anthem-esque.  Club mixes are all about big sounds in a vain attempt to keep from being drowned out in the hustle of late-night dancing and in doing so, share the self righteousness that Anthem Trance (see Ishkur's guide) is known for; all tension and power without any release.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-hi-nrg-mix.mp3">Anabolic Frolic's HI-NRG mix</a></li>
</ul>
[HI-NRG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-NRG) is the music of raver kiddies.  If you've ever seen the movie <em>[Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%281999_film%29)</em>, you know what raves are about.  Lots of drugs, [ecstacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in particular, sex and dancing...all..night...long.  The dancing, not the sex.  Really.  Only when rolling would one feel the need to dance to such fast-paced music for 10 hours straight.  150 beats per minute is the minimum here, folks.  A continuous rising and falling ethereal piano is a staple of HI-NRG, as are the high-pitched vocals replacing the calmer and more subdued singing of Madonna.  [Anabolic Frolic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Frolic)'s Happy2bHardcore series of mix albums is characteristic of the genre.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-gabber-mix.mp3">Gabber mix</a></li>
</ul>
150 beats per minute, no less.  Deafening bass beats, chipmunk vocals and hard charging melodies.  These are the tenets of [gabber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber).  The original song?  Yeah, it's in there somewhere, represented in the tings, thumps and industrial sounds pervasive within the gabber genre.  When someone who doesn't enjoy electronic music (or, more often, thinks they won't like it) describes "techno," this is what a sketch artist would build from their description.  In reality, however, gabber is on the fringe of the electronic genre, the bastard child of [industrial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music) and HI-NRG.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dinomite.net/static/music/like-a-prayer-darkcore-mix.mp3">Mr. Bungle's darkcore mix</a></li>
</ul>
You probably wouldn't have guessed that someone could make <em>Like a Prayer</em> sound evil and depressing, but here it is.  Replace the vocals with those of an angsty adolescent, simplify the beats down to electronic drum hits, replace the melody with a spartan version from a machine and you've got yourself [darkcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkcore).

Windows Server 2003 (or maybe it's just Internet Explorer 7) has a number of wonderful features that will make every day a cheery adventure.  Among them are draconian security policies that, beyond making little sense, are controlled from places they don't belong.  Apparently a mapped network share is considered a web page.  Who would have guessed that?  Well, if you get the error in the title when trying to run or even right-click something from a share on the network, it can be fixed from Internet Options.  From IE7, press 'alt' to show the menu, go to Tools>Internet Options.  In the Internet Options window, go to the security tab, select the 'Internet' zone and click 'Custom' near the bottom right.  In the resulting window under 'Miscellaneous', set things that say 'disable' to 'prompt' or 'enable'.  I'm not sure which one controls the above mentioned behavior, but it ought to be fairly obvious which are involved; just allow them.

<p>Instead you can:</p>

<p>(in IE) tools, options, 'secutity' tab.
 select the Local Intranet zone
 Click 'Sites'
 Add "file://-server-name-"</p>

<p>this adds all file connections to that server to the local (super-trusted) intranet zone. this includes mapped drives to that server</p>

<p>IE7 (on server 2003 SP2 R2) no longer appears to automatically have 'LocalSubnet' in the 'local intranet' zone.</p>

<p>Key reasoning behind this is probably to (generally) block executing files from file servers etc and thus close off one vector of virus/trojan attack.. A very good (security) move by MS. [IMHO].
Where a centralised 'repositry' deployment server is needed (where all the EXE install sources are kept), this can be set READ-ONLY and added to the trusted zone.. A good case for a 'dirt cheap' NAS disk drive..
In a domain (AD) this is more than likely acheivable inside 30 seconds using GPO.</p>

<p>With R2's (or is it SP2) File Screening service, one can finally achieve a serious level of network control over users downloading exe's etc.. </p>

<p>Here is another option that worked for me. My situation might be slightly different. Copied a .ZIP to a hardened DMZ server (W2K3). The file is now local. It is not on a share. I found answers suggesting the uninstall of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (Windows Add/Remove Components).</p>

<p>My approach -- Start | Run | Cmd.exe
In the new command window console, "cd" to the location of my ZIP.
Type "myzipfile.zip" to run it with the default program (being the Windows built-in "Compressed (zipped) folders" plugin).</p>

<p>This successfully opened an explorer window of the compressed folder, which I could then extract.</p>

<p>This is a completely pointless security feature and atleast could have been implemented to show a helpful error message that directs you to IE7 to change the setting. As it is, it makes no sense whatsoever to manage such security in IE7 and not many people would think to look there. Ok you can google it and find the problem within minutes, but it's just downright unhelpful and OTT security.</p>

BODY:
`psad` (PortScan Attack Detector) is a useful tool for detecting portscans against a system and, optionally, blocking the offending host.  To use `psad` you configure your firewall to drop and log all packets that are not specifically allowed, i.e., those that are handled by services on the machine.  The configuration for `psad` can cause a little bit of grief because it depends on some quite particular firewall setup and, if you don't want massive logfiles, some editing of `syslog.conf`.  To begin with, you'll need to install `psad` which can be done via apt:

<code><pre>
$ sudo aptitude install psad
</pre></code>

There are some configuration details that should be changed in `/etc/psad/psad.conf`, most notably the hostname and email variables.  Make sure that if you set the email address to something other than one of the accounts on the machine that your mail daemon is setup to deliver mail to the outside world.  Next, setup the firewall to accept packets for the services that your machine runs then drop and log all others.  In this example, the machine runs a web server (port 80) and ssh (port 22):

<code><pre>
$ sudo iptables -F INPUT
$ sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "DROP " --log-level debug
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
</pre></code>

Which should probably be put into a script that will be run on startup.  Finally alter the `/etc/syslog.conf` so that your `/var/log/messages` doesn't fill up as the second-to-last rule above  writes a logline each time a packet is dropped.  First, I changed the line that controls `kern.log` from this:

<code><pre>
kern.*				-/var/log/kern.log
</pre></code>

to this:

<code><pre>
kern.info;kern.!debug		-/var/log/kern.log
</pre></code>

and adding this line at the end:

<code><pre>
*.=debug	|/var/lib/psad/psadfifo
</pre></code>

The first syslog change keeps your /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/messages from getting a line each time a packet is dropped (which is quite often) and the latter change sends all those dropped packet notifications (which are at the 'debug' loglevel) to psad.

BODY:
Making your own Perl modules is actually really easy, only involving a few special alterations to a script and an environment variable to make them easy to utilize.  To make Perl modules, you first need to understand Object Oriented Perl, so if that's new to you, check out [Tom's object-oriented Perl Tutorial](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/pod/perltoot.pod).  Onward.

For this example, I'll just use a simplified version of the 'Person' class from the above-mentioned tutorial:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
package Person;
use strict;

sub new {
	my $self  = {
		NAME => undef,
		AGE => undef,
		PEERS => [],
	};
	bless($self);
	return $self;
}
sub name {
	my $self = shift;
	if (@_) { $self->{NAME} = shift }
	return $self->{NAME};
}
sub age {
	my $self = shift;
	if (@_) { $self->{AGE} = shift }
	return $self->{AGE};
}
sub peers {
	my $self = shift;
	if (@_) { @{ $self->{PEERS} } = @_ }
	return @{ $self->{PEERS} };
}
1;
</pre>

To begin with, let's make a directory where you will put all the modules you make; say, `~/perl-modules`.  Take the code above and save it as `Person.pm` in your new `perl-modules` directory.  Notice the `.pm` extension that `perl` will look for when you go to `use` this module.  Now, we need to let `perl` know where to look for the modules you write.  When you ask for a Perl module by writing `use foo` in a script, `perl`, by default, it looks in a bunch of system directories and in the current directory for anything named `foo.pm`.  You can tell it to look other places by adding to the `PERL5LIB` environment variable.  For ease, I simply put this into my `.bashrc`:

<pre>
export PERL5LIB=~/perl-modules
</pre>

Now, anywhere that I write a perl script, I can simply say `use Person` and the Person class will be grabbed from my `perl-modules` directory.

Another thing to keep in mind when writing modules is that you should load the `Carp` module and use the functions `carp` and `croak` rather than `warn` and `die` respectively.  `Carp`'s functions produce errors that reference the proper context in the user's code when an error occurs, rather then saying there is a problem in your module.

I came across a post today in which someone mentioned that they used Perl for text replacement and, despite the simplicity of the solution, I hadn't ever thought of it.  By simply using three options with the `perl` command, you can run a quick script to do regex replacement in a file.  The `-p` option tells Perl to treat your script as a loop, reading in from the diamond (`<>`) operator.  `-i` makes it do in-place editing of files and `-e` allows you to script from the command line.  For example:

<code><pre>
~$ perl -p -i -e "s/foo/bar/g" baz.txt
</code></pre>

The above command will replace 'foo' with 'bar' throughout the file 'baz.txt'

<p>hi
i'm trinig to add one word in the end of specific line ( line X )
do you know how can i run this command form a perl script :</p>

<p>sed -i "3s/$/text/" file.txt   ( the line here is : 3)</p>

<p>i tried your command :
perl -p -i -e "3s/$/text/" file.txt</p>

<p>but i got error :
syntax error at -e line 1, near "3s/$/text/"
Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.</p>

<p>without the number : "3" , it is working</p>

<p>I don't believe that what you intend to do with Perl is possible in that fashion; Perl's s/// operator is meant to operate on a single line and pays no attention to line numbers.  To do what you want, the Perl code simply needs to be a bit more complex:</p>

<p>perl -p -i -e "s/$/text/ if $. == 3" file.txt</p>

<p>That if checks Perl's $INPUT_LINE_NUMBER which is also known as $..  See <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/06/18/variables.html" rel="nofollow">this article on Perl's special variables</a>.</p>

So you've written a Perl program and want to give it to someone else.  The only problem is, like any good Perl program, you've made good use of modules, some of which may be non-standard.  The person in question may not be able to install modules on the machine they're going to be running your script on, or maybe you just don't want to hassle them with that.  The easy way is to give them the modules in the proper directory structure right alongside your program; they simply toss the group of modules in the same directory as the script and when it's run the Perl interpreter searches . (the current directory) for the modules, finds them and goes about its merry way.

The only hiccup, some of the modules you've used depend on other modules...which may have further dependencies.  Rather than suffer through dependency reminiscent of Red Hat (even the newest version...), you can use the Devel::Modlist module which will tell you which modules are required to run the program.  Invoked with the 'nocore' option, Devel::Modlist will ignore standard modules, which ought to be installed with any Perl distribution.  Here is an example from a program I wrote; the only module I invoke directly is XML::SAX.

<pre><code>
~/code$ perl -d -MDevel::Modlist=nocore merge.pl foo.xml bar.xml

[IzPack](http://www.izpack.org) is a great installer written in Java and configured with XML files, though the documentation can be a little bit lacking.  This OK because the variables are all named well so one can easily look to an existing installer (such as that for IzPack itself or 7-zip) and copy needed bits of code.  One thing that I found elusive was how to set the default install directory to something other than "C:\Program Files\&lt;product name&gt;".  The &lt;info&gt; element provides an &lt;appsubpath&gt; element that allows you to specify something other than &lt;product name&gt;, but you're still limited to something within the default Windows installation directory.  Alas, mailing lists to the rescue!  [This post](https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/izpack-users/2006-November/002928.html) describes declaring a resource in the install.xml and after a bit of fiddling I came up with the following.

First, create a file TargetDir.txt with nothing more than the path you want to install at, for me that file simply contained "C:\foo".  Next, point to the resource in the install.xml:

<code><pre>
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;!-- Set the default installation directory shown in the TargetPanel --&gt;
    &lt;res id="TargetPanel.dir" src="TargetDir.txt" /&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</pre></code>

Rebuild the installer and you're set.

Thanks! This was very helpful! Unfortunately, for the console (headless) version it seems to not default to the value I place into the TargetDir.txt. If I open it up in the standard way then the path will be set correctly. Would appreciate it if you could help me out with this!

[In our last episode](http://dinomite.net/archives/tar-over-ssh) we used tar to move a file structure across the network.  This time, to create a tarball directly onto another machine the following command can be used:

<code>
tar czf - foo/ | ssh user@host "cat > /path/to/foo.tgz"
</code>

This is useful if the machine you're taring from doesn't have enough disk space to hold the tarball.  Furthermore, it's probably faster because the tarball is only being written once, directly to its final location.

Like many 'enterprise solutions,' Oracle is a despicable piece of software that has a tendency to eat copious amounts of memory and processor time.  Alas, ranting on my hatred of enterprise hardware and software is not the subject of this post.  A big part of enterprise applications is that they are usually accompanied by abundant amounts of documentation, sadly, much of it useless.  The tomes (physical or electronic) included often overlook the simplest of functions delving straight into the guts of the system and focusing on minutiae.  Despite the fact that everyone needs to perform these elementary tasks that are buried deep within the documentation, it's often difficult to find a solution by searching the internet.  My search for how to use `sqlplus` to connect to a remote database (I had previously only used it locally, on the server running Oracle) turned up a few results and led me to this solution:

<code>
~$ sqlplus uname/pass@[//hostname[:port]/]sid
</code>

Really, it's quite straightforward.

BODY:
Amongst all of the recent news about climate change, I started hearing about large corporations, even oil and car companies, who were backing legislation such as carbon caps.  The most notable of these groups is the [US Climate Action Partnership](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Climate_Action_Partnership) which includes companies like BP America and PG&E that are throughly tied to fossil fuels.  Why are these companies supportive of legislation that will create wholesale changes in the manner in which their industries operate?

First and foremost, these companies aren't stupid and realize that, given the current political climate where human-induced global warming has become accepted as truth, their best move is to mitigate the effects of legislation that changes the way their businesses operate.  The best way to run any business is to simply keep on trucking; if you can sell the same product or service without having to change what you deliver or the manner in which you create it, your operating costs will be very low.  A cap-and-trade system would certainly change the way any carbon-producing industry must operate, but it probably wouldn't require as much change in facilities and production methods as more specifically defined legislation.  Cap-and-trade simply states, "Either release less carbon or buy the right to pollute more from someone else."  This gives companies a lot of options.

The more sinister reason that carbon producers support cap-and-trade legislation is that they know the world is changing.  Alternative fuels are gaining momentum as gas prices soar and hatred of pollution and high prices adds to the animosity towards carbon-based fuels.  Tempering this hatred with pseudo-green initiatives like supporting carbon-control legislation may help fossil-fuel dependent companies stand up to other energy sources.  This also has the side effect of possibly convincing some rainy-day environmentalists that oil companies aren't so bad after all.

I found a new, easy process for installing VMware on Ubuntu, having updated the kernel on my Feisty machine since the last time I used the virtual machine.  Whenever the kernel changes, VMware needs to rebuild it's kernel module to suit, via the script `vmware-config.pl`.  This involves a few steps such that VMware can correctly build it's module against the kernel you're running.  First, you need to grab the headers for your running kernel and set them up to support building:

<pre>
~$ sudo -i
~# aptitude install linux-headers-`uname -r`
~# cd /usr/src/
/usr/src# ln -s linux-headers-2.6.20-16-`uname -r` linux
/usr/src# cd linux
/usr/src/linux# cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
/usr/src/linux# make oldconfig && make prepare0 && make scripts
</pre>

The above installs the kernel headers for your current kernel (`uname -r' gives the running kernel's version), gets the `.config` for said kernel and preps the headers per the `.config`.  Now, on to the VMware part of things.

Installing VMware is really easy, thanks to [this patch](http://ftp.cvut.cz/vmware/vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz).  You simply need to get the patch, untar and run it; the script included invokes the VMware configurator automatically.

<pre>
/usr/src# wget http://ftp.cvut.cz/vmware/vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
/usr/src# tar zxf vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
/usr/src# cd vmware-any-any-update109
/usr/src/vmware-any-any-update109# ./runme.pl
</pre>

Follow the directions provided by the VMware configuration script (the defaults are safe, but read the information) and you're done.

<p>I'm not sure about the problem you're having, though a quick search turned up <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=386841" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gksu/+bug/23917" rel="nofollow">two</a> discussions on the subject.</p>

<p>As for VMware, most people will be happy with VMware Server, which Feisty has packages for.  For more information on that, see <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-vmware-server-from-canonical-commercial-repository-in-ubuntu-feisty.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on Ubuntu Geek.  The quick rundown is that you need to add the commercial repository (deb <a href="http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu" rel="nofollow">http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu</a></a> feisty-commercial main) to your sources.list, run apt-get update and then install vmware-server along with vmware-tools-kernel-modules.</p>

With large hard drives becoming cheap and external enclosures easy to find, many people are finally beginning to perform backups of their data.  While an external drive is a good step that will mitigate the risk of the main drive's failure or an accidental deletion, it doesn't protect from the worse, albeit more rare risks of fire and theft.  I say this and now I'm about to delve into some Linux jazz that doesn't apply to normal users.  Oh well.

I keep regular backups (I'm actually lucky enough to have an offsite location to put them) but want to keep my most important data in another place as well and to do so, I occasionally burn a DVD with said data.  My only concern with this is that if I, say, leave it in my car now my potentially private data is even more susceptible to theft.  In order to make this a non-issue, I use the following command to create encrypted and gzipped tar archives:

<code><pre>
tar -chf - foo/ | gzip - | gpg -e -r Drew > foo.tar.gz.gpg
</code></pre>

Quite simple, really.

Reading the [Slashdot thread](http://bsd.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/19/1847206) about [PC-BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-BSD) someone mentioned that there was a VMWare image pre-installed for playing around with it.  On the [download page](http://www.pcbsd.org/?p=download#vmware), in addition to being able to select mirrors, as one expects with a large file, there was a [Metalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalink).  Not to be confused with Oracle's worthless support website, Metalinks are files that describe methods for obtaining a file, in this case, HTTP and FTP locations where it is available and hashes for pieces of the file.  After first trying a couple of mirrors and only getting ~60Kb/s I grabbed the Metalink file and installed [Aria2](http://aria2.sourceforge.net/), a command-line Metalink downloader.  I simply pointed aria2 to the Metalink file (it can also take the URL of the Metalink) and it started downloading from 15 of the servers in the list simultaneously.  Needless to say, this resulted in a *much* faster download.  More information about Metalinks, including projects that employ them, can be found at the [Metalink website](http://metalinker.org/).

<p>VMWare images are so nice for just trying something out. PC-BSD is pretty cool too.</p>

<p>aria2 is a great downloader in general, besides supporting metalink. It does regular downloads as well as torrents, and uses minimal system resources.</p>

<p>Besides the usual speed of metalink downloads, the other nice things are convenience and automatic error correction. I occasionally get corrupted downloads over ftp/http, but if there's a metalink available, and you use aria2, it can correct the downloads if there are chunk checksums in the metalink. repairing a small portion of a 600 meg download is so much better than having to restart it from scratch.</p>

I just finish reading Sam Harris' <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em>, which is a very good book.  At one point he notes that the bible stipulates [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) is exactly 3.  I wondered how such a book would lay out mathematical constants, but it's pretty straightforward:

<blockquote>
The sea was then cast; it was made with a circular rim, and measured ten cubits across, five in height, and thirty in circumference.
Under the brim, gourds encircled it, ten to the cubit all the way around; the gourds were in two rows and were cast in one mold with the sea.
</blockquote>
Kings 7:23-24

<blockquote>
He also made the molten sea. It was perfectly round, ten cubits in diameter, five in depth, and thirty in circumference
</blockquote>
II Chronicles 4:2

I must say that it's a weak argument, because they could be simply approximations by an observer, but it's funny nonetheless.

Velde, [outlined a plan](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/business/01scenes.html?ex=1327986000&en=fc1b2020abae45d6&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) to rid the country of the 1 cent penny entirely.  He does not advocate debasing [pennies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_%28United_States_coin%29), making them out of cheaper materials than the current mix of Copper plating around a Zinc core, which has been done previously (think steel pennies).  Rather, Verde proposes changing the value of the penny from one to five cents.  As the New York Times article explains, there won't really be any financial wizardry involved; the penny you hold would immediately increase in value five fold.  That's the best rate you can get short of winning the lottery and it's enough to make me want to gather up thousands of pennies to store under my mattress.

My only thought is, when if it's decided that The Fed will change the value of the penny, wouldn't there be a mad rush to acquire pennies before the switch?  You'd definitely see me in line at the bank.

<p>Has anyone collected pennies with dates 1982 and prior? I have been doing it for a long time, in my walks I always pick up pennies; many people pass them by,  so now I have bottles of pennies. </p>

<p>We are in an era of fiat currency meaning more people have incomes, thus they have purchasing power. The amount of fiat currency is unlimited, the amount of commodities is limited.  Because we are in a globilized economy we have not experienced hyperinflation. It is just a matter of time before we experience competive pressures for commodities. </p>

<p>I also collect nickels, but I don't find many of these laying around in my walks.</p>

NPR's [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2) had a story about a [Minnesota National Guard unit](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7085635) that has been told that their stay in Iraq will be extended, like many other of our deployed forces in the world.  One of the soldiers in the unit was given the opportunity to pose a question to President Bush during his interview with NPR's Juan Williams.  The soldier asked whether the President had a plan for Iraq if the troop surge didn't have the intended effect, to which Bush responded,

<blockquote>
Well, I would say to Ryan, I put it in place on the advice of a lot of smart people, particularly the military people who think it will work, and let us go into this aspect of the Iraqi strategy feeling it will work. But I will also assure Ryan that we're constantly adjusting to conditions on the ground.
</blockquote>

Wow.  That plays right along with Bush's idea that everything he does will be successful and that there is no need for backup plans.  Thanks for answering that question, next time you can just say "no."  Thankfully, the soldier understood the true meaning of Bush's response and had this to say upon hearing it:

<blockquote>
No, it did not answer my question.  I would have liked to know more so that there will be a plan if this does not work. For some of us that are over here, particularly me, my unit, we all feel, what's the point of us being extended if your initial plan to send more troops over here does not work? What are you going to do, Mr. President?
</blockquote>

Will Bush get the troop surge?  There really is a good chance (I'd say it's a forgone conclusion) that the troop surge won't fix anything.  What will happen then?

BODY:
`scp` is great for ease of use, but if you're transferring numerous files, small ones in particular, it isn't the fastest method.  `tar`, however, is very well suited to gathering small files into a single unit, but `tar`ing the files, `scp`ing the tarball and then un-`tar`ing on the other end is inefficient; we have pipes in unix for a reason.  Like all good command line utilities, tar can dish out and accept input from a pipe, so this is really quite straightforward:

<code>
tar cf - sourcedir/ | ssh user@dest_host tar xf - -C /destination/path
</code>

Make note of those naked dashes - they are the secret to this whole operation.  First we call the `tar` command with the options to <b>c</b>reate a tarball and that the <b>f</b>ilename to output immediately follows the options; in this case, we tell it to pipe the output to `stdout`.  Finally, we give the first `tar` command the list of files (a directory in this example) that we want sent.  The output of that tar command (the tarball itself, since we directed output to `stdout`) gets piped to `ssh` which is invoked like you normally would, except with a command to run tacked on the end.  As soon as `ssh` connects to the destination host, it simply runs `tar`, which listens for an input file coming from `stdin` that it will unpack into the directory given by `-C`.

<addendum>
I noticed that a lot of people Google for "tar over scp", which might be your first thought if you've never done this before.  This note is just to help those people out, because this is most likely the solution they are in search of.

BODY:
Anyone who has worked with large numbers of files has seen the error '`Argument list too long`' returned by a command before, usually something like `cp` or `rm`.  Eventually, they find `xargs` and all is well again; rather than globbing directly, you use `find` and `xargs` to feed the intended command:

<pre>
~/tmp$ ls | wc -l
77029
~/tmp$ cp * /foo/bar/
bash: /bin/cp: Argument list too long
~/tmp$ find . -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} cp {} /foo/bar/
</pre>

For those who don't know, that final command is running find, which simply prints a list of the files in the current directory.  `xargs` then passes a not-too-long subset of that list to `cp` in batches, replacing the {} with said list.  The `-print0` tells `find` to terminate each filename with a null character rather than the default newline, so that weird filenames work; the corresponding option `-0` must be used with `xargs` so that it looks for that syntax.  Now, on to the problem of the day.

I know `xargs`, but for the problem I had, I didn't think it would help (more on that later).  I wanted to `tar` up a whole bunch of files, too many for the command line to handle.  The solution was simple, for `tar` provides an option to receive its list of files that makeup an archive from a file:

<pre>
~/tmp$ find . -print > baz.lst
~/tmp$ tar -cf baz.tar --files-from baz.lst
</pre>

Simple.  There's probably a way to one-line that, but simply piping the output of `find` to tar with `--files-from -` didn't work, and I didn't spend any more time trying to figure it out.  As I said previously, I didn't think `xargs` would help, but I pulled up the `tar` manpage and, using the `-r` option, you can append to an existing archive, which could work in conjunction with `xargs` just fine.

[Representative Marsha Blackburn ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn) (R, TN) made the most blatant invocation of patriotism as a scare tactic that I've ever heard in the debate over the non-binding resolution to condemn President Bush's troop surge.

<blockquote>
Rep. Blackburn: I think the question we have to ask is who's side are you on?  Who's side are you on?  Are you on the side of freedom?  Are you on the side of allowing the terrorists to get an upper hand?
</blockquote>

Wow, could you be more of a fear monger?  Remember, if you don't support a war in which thousands of American soldiers have died, countless more (really, find the statistics) have been maimed and costs us billions each year, then you're on the side of the terrorists.

I recently got a bluetooth headset to use with my Motorola Razr and it works wonderfully, with the one drawback that having bluetooth enabled on the phone all the time reduces its battery life from 5-6 days standby, to 3-4.  I thought that turning bluetooth on and off was a pain, requiring navigating 6 menus deep to do so, until I saw the option for shortcuts in another configuration menu.  Shortcuts are easy to setup and make doing anything, including enabling or disabling bluetooth, a snap.

To setup a shortcut, you simply navigat to the menu option you want as a shortcut, in this case Settings > Connection > Bluetooth Link > Setup > Power.  Then, highlight 'on' and hold down the menu key (top middle button) until a popup asks you if you want to assign a shortcut.  Say yes, and then assign it the key '1', the default.  Do the same for 'off' in the bluetooth power menu, assigning it the key '2'.  Now, you can simply press the menu button and then 1 or 2 to turn bluetooth on or off.  Shortcuts can be altered from the Settings > Tools > Shortcuts menu.  I'm very happy that Motorola included the shortcuts feature, in particular because the Razr's interface is so blindingly slow.

[This guy](http://www.micropersuasion.com) has a [very good tip](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/02/transform_gmail.html) on how to use Gmail to store arbitrary information.  I'm sure everyone has at sometime used some web-based email as a method of either moving data or otherwise storing something, by simply sending a message to yourself.  Well, he goes a step further and setup a way to automatically take emails sent to a specific sub address (`yourname+something@gmail.com`) and archive them away.  Simply setup a filter to take anything sent to `yourname+database@gmail.com`, apply the label 'database' and archive it.  When you come across something interesting on the internets, simply email it to `yourname+database@gmail.com` and it will skip your inbox but be held forevermore in Gmail's coffers.  To recall it later, just run a search for `label:database keywords` and google will search through your database.

Rubel goes a step further, using Google Toolbar's 'send to Gmail' function which takes the page you're currently looking at and pipes it to an email.  Just toss in your database address and send it to be stored.

Many people spend their Sunday mornings going to church for an hour or two, which I argue is a waste of time.  I don't expect to convince anyone to give up religion altogether by saying this, but that's really beside the point; church is a waste of time, even for the religious.  From a theological perspective, God wants you to respect him and obey the tenets of your religion, but most of all, religion is supposed to help you have a good life.  Now, I'm sure some people do get a lot out of hearing a sermon once a week, or meeting with like-minded people, but undoubtedly many simple see it as a necessary chore to maintaining their faith.  My alternative is simple: exercise.

From the perspective of the CDC, AMA or any number of other health-minded organizations, the vast majority of Americans are significantly overweight and get much less exercise then they ought to.  Quite simply, spending an hour or two every Sunday exercising would greatly improve this situation and is significantly beneficial from a psychological standpoint as well.  On the surface, it would seem that a religious sermon would be more beneficial for mental well being than physical exercise.  Studies show, however, that the mental benefits resulting from exercise are as profound as the physiological ones.  Exercise improves mood, alertness and overall affect for days afterward.  A good sermon can change ones life, or improve mood as well, but most sermons aren't that inspiring, and hearing someone talk does a lot less for preventing a heart attack than regular exercise.

It is generally accepted that when developing Perl, you should be using warnings (`use warnings`) and recommended that you go a step further with `use strict`, which forces the declaration of variables with `my` before they are used, among other things.  Beyond these two, however, is the [`B::Lint`](http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/ext/B/B/Lint.pm) module that performs [further checks on your code](http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/lib/B/Lint.html).  Using it couldn't be simpler; simply pass the option `-MO=Lint,all` to the Perl command when invoking your program.  The `-M` option tells Perl that you want to use the module specified, and '`,all`' is an option passed to the Lint module, telling it to perform all checks, which is probably what you want.  If you have some bad habit, or want it to specifically skip some checks, you can add that on to the argument list, prepending the option listed in [the documentation](http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/ext/B/B/Lint.pm) with 'no-'.

Many people don't have a clue how to use old-school Unix commands such as `sed` and I can say that I was in that camp until recently.  Previously, I would be more inclined to write a script in Perl or open up vi to perform complex and repetitive replacement tasks across multiple files.  I'm comfortable with both Perl and vi, most importantly their regular expressions which allow for quick and easy manipulation of text.  I was pushed to learn `sed` when I had a number of different files that all needed a very similar modification to each of their thousands of lines.  Sure I could write a Perl script to do it, but it was a good opportunity to learn the stream editor and I'm glad I did.

The most useful thing `sed` can do is regex-based alterations to files just like vi, except you can apply a `sed` command to multiple files from the command line with a simple glob.  The syntax for `sed` regex is much like that for `vi` or Perl; the big difference that I encountered as compared to Perl is that capturing with parenthesis is done using backslash-escaped parenthesis and the later references with backslash-escaped numbers.  If you run `sed` without any options, it takes a regex and any number of input files; the output will be to standard out, so `sed 's/foo/bar/' *.txt` will replace 'foo' with 'bar' in all text files in the current directory, showing you the results on `STDOUT`. This is great to test and make sure the right changes are going to be made, but to actually make the changes, the best method is to use `sed`'s in-place editing option, `-i`.  Now, if you run `sed -i 's/foo/bar/' *.txt`, `sed` will replace 'foo' with 'bar' in all files in the current directory, altering each of the files.

This is a hack of the script `rsnaptar` included with the rsnapshot distribution.  In short, it takes a  few rsnapshot directories, runs them through `tar`, `gzip` and `gpg` finally depositing the results on another machine.  I wrote this so that I could grab the backups from a server at work and routinely toss them onto a DVD that I take home with me.  It's a bad idea to be walking around with all of the company's source code, hence the GPG.  The magic all happens on one line which runs `tar`, piping the output to `ssh` which runs `gzip` reading from stdin on the remote machine then on to `gpg` dumping its output wherever you want.

One of the rotating taglines in the subtitle of this website is the line that is the title of this post:
"You're tuned into Perfecto Radio, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles"
<img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/perfecto.JPG' class='alignright' alt='Perfecto Records' />
A few weeks ago, I receive and email from someone wondering which [Paul Oakenfold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold) record it comes from, because my link simply pointed to the Wikipedia page for [Perfecto Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfecto_Records); apparently my site is the [only hit on Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=%22you%27re+tuned+into+perfecto+radio%2C+new+york+city%2C+miami%2C+los+angeles%22&btnG=Search) when you search for that phrase.  For the life of me, I couldn't remember, nor was I able to find it in a cursory search of my Oakenfold albums, which I informed the questioner.  I recently got a response and it turns out the line is at the beginning of the Chilled Eskimo's <em>Take Me Away</em> on Oakenfold's <strong>Perfecto Presents Another World</strong>.  Now this answer is forever recorded on the internet for all to know.

Just listening to this album again and at the end of Tatoine's <em>Music</em> a similar phrase is said, "You're tuned into Perfecto Radio, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle."

I came across this on the Verizon billing page today when entering my account number:
<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/west_fios_small.gif' title='FIOS Account Number'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/west_fios_small.gif' alt='FIOS Account Number' /></a>

I don't know why they print all that extra jazz on either side of the account number, there's probably a good reason, but why tell me that I should exclude some of it, particularly when the entire thing is labeled "Account Number"?  Is it really beyond their abilities to cut 6 characters off the beginning and 2 off the end of my input?  Beyond that, if they want to use the inner subset of numbers as the account number, could it at least be labeled properly on the bill?

This reminded me of nonsense from the Arlington County Library page:
<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/arlington-library-online.jpg' title='Arlington County library online'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/arlington-library-online.jpg' alt='Arlington County library online' /></a>

Their web application ought to prepend "2020" to what I enter; the user simply shouldn't be bothered with this.

I was having trouble with my Nortel Contivity VPN client disconnecting giving an error message, "The routing table cannot be altered after the Contivity VPN Connection has been established. The Contivity VPN Connection has been Closed."  This would happen after 10-20 minutes of being connected and would cause all of my SSH sessions to drop, which made it hard to get work done.  After some searching, I found the solution to my problem, a simple registry addition.  I added the DWORD named "PerformRouterDiscovery" with the value 0 to the key `"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters"`.  After rebooting, the VPN works without the random disconnects.  Download [this .reg file](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/performrouterdiscovery.reg) and run it to add the aforementioned key.

An SSH tunnel is a great way to quickly setup a secure method for browsing the web from an unsecure location, such as a public wireless network.  All you need is a machine running an SSH server.  I setup a tunnel from my Mac OS X laptop using the following command:

<pre>
ssh -C -D 7070 dinomite.net
</pre>

This sets up a tunnel, locally accessible on the laptop on port 7070 (`-D 7070`), that sends any traffic through the encrypted and compressed (`-C`) SSH stream to the server, where it is spit out onto the net as normal.  To use this tunnel, I simply instruct Firefox to connect via a SOCKS proxy on port 7070:

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/settings.png' title='Firefox 2 Advanced Settings Window'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/settings.png' alt='Firefox 2 Advanced Settings Window' /></a>

Many other applications, such as Adium, support SOCKS proxies and can be set up in a similar way to send their traffic to port 7070 and take advantage of an SSH tunnel.

I use VMware to run a virtual Windows machine for my company's VPN and the occasional game of Starcraft.  When I moved and switch from a wired network to wireless, the device with which I connect to the internet changed from good old `eth0` to the new-fangled `ath0`.  VMware was setup to tie its virtual interface for bridged networking to `eth0`.  Since `eth0` no longer has a network connection, the virtual machine lost the internet as well.  To fix this, I had to open `/etc/vmware/locations` and change the reference to `eth0` to `ath0`.  The virtual interface that I use is `vmnet0` so the line in the file referenced `VNET_0_INTERFACE`.  Simply changing that line and restarting the VMware backend (`/etc/init.d/vmware restart`) fixed everything.

BODY:
EXMAP is a shared memory analysis utility that makes it easy to determine exactly how much memory a process is using.  Unlike `top`, which counts all memory shared amongst programs toward each of those programs, EXMAP gives three numbers most notable of which is "Effective Resident" memory usage.  This number is the amount of memory mapped directly by a process, plus a portion of any shared memory pools it is part of, that is, the program is only counted as using an equal portion of shared memory as all other processes that are sharing the same.

On my system, both Gaim (Pidgin my foot) and Evolution are using aspell.  In top, they are both responsible for libaspell.so in its entirety, contributing 672K to each of their displayed memory usage.  EXMAP puts 338K towards Gaim and 334K to Evolution, a much more accurate tally, since only a single instance of libaspell is actually in memory, shared by the two other processes.  From my quick testing, it seems that subsequent users of shared memory take the larger share, 4K more in Gaim's case, since I started it after Evolution.  If I close Gaim, Evolution is then credited with the entire 632K of memory that libaspell occupies.

So, on to installing EXMAP which certainly isn't hard, but requires a kernel module which makes it non-trivial.  First, use `apt-get` (or really, it's better replacement `aptitude`) to install EXMAP, the required kernel module source and the stuff you'll need to build said module:

<pre>
sudo -i
aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
aptitude install module-assistant build-essential
aptitude install exmap exmap-modules-source
</pre>

Then, build the EXMAP module:

<pre>
module-assistant prepare
module-assistant update
module-assistant build exmap
module-assistant install exmap
depmod
modprobe exmap
echo exmap >> /etc/modules
</pre>

`module-assistant` automatically compiles and installs the module against the kernel headers that `aptitude` installed in the previous block and `depmod` calculates the dependencies amongst all modules, including the new EXMAP one.  `modprobe` installs the new module into the kernel and adding its name to `/etc/modules` ensures that it will be ready next time your system restarts as well.  Once all that is done, you can run `gexmap`.

Just a small note, on my Gutsy system I also had to install 'debhelper', otherwise the module would not compile ('dh_testdir' not found).

Since we're going all-wireless in my new house, I had to setup my Ubuntu machine with a wireless card.  All of the slots on the computer are filled, so I grabbed a Linksys WUSB54G USB (hence the model number) adapter.  Installing it required some terminal work, unusual for Ubuntu.  [This thread](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=478558) gives a somewhat cryptic outline of the steps required to get the card working and following them requires a bit of Linux experience.  For the unexperienced, read on.

After plugging the card in on my Feisty machine, it came up in the network manager (System > Administration > Network) but wouldn't connect to any networks, be they open or encrypted, G or B, nothing.  So I retreated to the interwebs and found that [ndiswrapper](http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/) was the solution to my problems.  To begin, install `ndiswrapper-utils-1.9`:

<pre>
~$ sudo aptitude install ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
</pre>

Then, download the latest driver from the Linksys site, unzip it and find the WUSB54Gv4 directory under the Drivers directory.  Run `ndiswrapper -v` and check to make sure there aren't any errors.  Then, install the new Linksys driver.

<pre>
~$ sudo ndiswrapper -i rt2500usb.inf
utils version: 1.9
driver version:        1.38
vermagic:       2.6.20-16-generic SMP mod_unload 586
~$ sudo depmod -a
~$ sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
~$ sudo ndiswrapper -m
</pre>

You have to blacklist the standard kernel driver so that it won't override the `ndiswrapper` driver.  To do so, add the following to the end of `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist`:

<pre>
# WUSB54G driver
blacklist rt2570
</pre>

Then, restart your machine and you should be able to configure wireless using the Gnome GUI tools.

After reading [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/EKWAN4FF44XY58J/?ALLSTEPS) I was very excited because I've recently started drinking a lot of seltzer water and I felt silly paying for something so simple.  I collected parts from eBay and some online distributors as follows:

* 15lbs. CO2 tank (eBay, $80 shipped)
* Regulator ([BeverageFactory.com](http://www.beveragefactory.com), $45)
* Carbonator cap ([MoreBeer.com](http://www.morebeer.com), $15)
* Tubing and adapters (hardware store, $5)
* Filled CO2 tank (Robert's Oxygen, $25)

It's a pretty simple arrangement, in the end.  Just hook the regulator up to the tank along with the tubing to the carbonator cap, adjust the pressure to 50PSI and then fizzy up a bottle of cold water.

It's not every day that you hear about a bank failure.  Prior to [NetBank's failure](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/NetBank.html) on Friday, the last was in February and that was the first in [two and a half years](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html).  Thanks to the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) (not to be confused with [The Fed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Reserve)), the impact of a bank's dissolution doesn't have much effect on its customers.  As detailed in the above-linked FDIC page on the NetBank failure, ING Direct will take over the accounts of NetBank and anyone with deposits less than the [FDIC insurance limit](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/archives/2007/05/fdic-insurance-what-if-my-bank-fails-make-sure-your-money-is-covered.html) won't suffer any loss at all.  Those with uninsured deposits (the amount exceeding $100,000) can only expect to see half of that amount:

<blockquote>
 Due to the projected sale of assets of the former bank, the FDIC is in the position to provide each uninsured depositor with an dividend equal to 50% of your uninsured amount. These funds will be deposited directly into your account net of your uninsured portion.
</blockquote>

The lesson?  This isn't the depression, but bank failures still happen.  If you keep your deposits under the FDIC limit then it's very much a non-issue; if you exceed those limits, you could sustain significant losses.  When Metrobank failed last February those with more than $100k at the bank got lucky because the FDIC was able to cover the relatively small amount of exceeding assets fully.  In the case of NetBank, the amount of uninsured assets are great enough that the FDIC isn't doing that again.

BODY:
Since Apple's recent release of Leopard, which comes with the wonderful backup solution <em>Time Machine</em>, I've seen more than a few articles explaining how those with Linux/Unix machines can create there own incremental backups using `rsync`.  This is great and, short of hard-linked directories, exactly like Apple's <em>Time Machine</em> backend.  Furthermore, this has always been possible on systems with `rsync` available and filesystems that support hardlinks.  I've been doing incremental backups for years but, unlike all of the recent articles in question, I didn't roll my own solution: I use 'rsnapshot' to do all of the hard work for me.

There are a [number](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/217) of [tutorials](www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/) for setting up `rsnapshot` and the process is really quite simple.  First, install `rsnapshot`; if you're using a system with a [good](http://www.debian.org) [package](http://www.ubuntu.org) [manager](http://www.freebsd.org), then this is a trivial operation:

<pre>
~$ sudo aptitude install rsnapshot
</pre>

Next, you must edit the `rsnapshot.conf` file which, in most Linux distributions, resides in `/etc`.  Note that the key/value pairs in this file must be <b>tab</b> delimited.  The file is well commented; the major things that need to be changed are:

* `snapshot_root` - where the backups will be stored
* backup intervals - how many of each interval to keep around (I do 7 dailys, 4 weeklys and 3 monthlys)
* backup points - what to backup

The last point requires some elaboration, as this is what `rsnapshot` will be backing up.  for a server that is only backing up it's own stuff this can be fairly simple:

<pre>
backup    /etc/            servername/
backup    /var/lib/svn/    servername/
backup    /home/           servername/
</pre>

Which tells `rsnapshot` to backup `/etc`, `/home` and the subversion repository and place them in the directory `servername` under the `snapshot_root` directory.  `rsnapshot` is also capable of backup up remote hosts via ssh:

<pre>
backup    root@remote:/etc/     remote/     +rsync_long_args=--bwlimit=120
backup    root@remote:/home/    remote/     +rsync_long_args=--bwlimit=120
</pre>

As above, this will backup the contents of the specified directories under the `remote_host` directory in your `snapshot_root` directory.  This also gives an example of passing arguments to `rsync` for that host.  I use this to backup my home machine to my server; since I'm on a residential internet link, I tell `rsync` to limit its bandwidth usage to 120 kilobytes per second when it is backing up this host to keep from saturating the pipe.

BODY:
There are literally hundreds of lists of the best Firefox extensions yet [few](http://db.rambleschmack.net/pc_tips/best_firefox_extensions) mention what I deem to be the most important: [Tab History](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1859).  A feature that I first became addicted to in [Galeon](http://galeon.sourceforge.net), Tab History causes newly created tabs created by middle-clicking a link or clicking "Open Link in New Tab" to inherit the history of their parent.

That is, I can run a search, open a whole bunch of the windows in tabs and then close the windows with reckless abandon once I decide one of the tabs fulfills my needs.  Later, if I find that the tab I'm reading doesn't have the information I was searching for, I don't need to ctrl+shift+t and sift through the tabs that I had prematurely closed searching for the web search that I had run.  Instead, because the tab in question was spawned from said search, I simply hit 'back' and head right back to the original page.

Similarly, if I'm reading an article opening links in new tabs as I go, I will usually close that article's tab before perusing the links that it contained.  If I happen upon one of those new tabs and have forgotten what the context for it was in the article, I can simply hit the back button to find the answer.

Tab History really is the most important Firefox extension to me.

Morgan Webb made a comparison between Amazon's new [Kindle](http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/sr=53-1/qid=1195527445/ref=tr_359161) eBook reader and a hardcover book.  Though she was simply trying to liken the Kindle to the nearest priced physical book product, this is a false comparison.  Someone buying a hardcover book is looking for something more than just the words and content of the story; they enjoy the physical representation of a fine work.  A more accurate comparison for the Kindle is a regular old paperback, whose purchaser is simply looking for the cheapest representation of the book's content.  At less than $15 for the average paperback, the Kindle doesn't look like such a good deal, since they charge $10 per book for the $400 device.

It was [widely](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119323518308669856-taIGTD5mNZR6XBXowkbFgXcyGx0_20071123.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top) [reported](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2007/tc20071024_654439.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_top+story)  [yesterday](http://money.cnn.com/2007/10/24/magazines/fortune/fastforward_microsoft_facebook.fortune/?postversion=2007102508) that Microsoft bought a 1.6% stake in [Facebook](http://facebook.com) for $240 million, thereby valuing the company at $15 billion.  Sure getting in on such a huge cache of advertising-ready eyeballs and consumer data is worth a lot, but the bid puts a price of $357 on each of Facebook's 42 million accounts.  [Marketplace's coverage](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/24/web_2_q/) put that number at $300 dollars, which takes into account Facebook's projection of 50 million accounts by the end of the year.  Beyond that, however, is the fact that an account doesn't necessarily mean a user; nothing stopped me from creating a Facebook page for the Pope and I know that Jesus [isn't actually my friend](https://dinomite.net/index.php?tag=atheism).  Furthermore, not all registered users regularly use the site.  I would bet that more than a quarter of my friends use facebook less than once a month, and even then only for a handful of page views (no, I don't want to be your super-best-buddy).  If we take my brash generalization at face value, leaving 30 million active users, they are each worth $500.  Do you really think you see $500 worth of ads on Facebook?

BODY:
[Data::Dumper](http://perldoc.perl.org/Data/Dumper.html) is one of the most useful Perl modules when developing code, providing quick and easy access to the contents of data structures.  Are you unsure whether you're setting the values of a hash correctly?  Don't understand how someone has organized an object that you're 'use'ing?  Data::Dumper to the rescue.

<pre>
use Data::Dumper;

my %foo;
$foo{'bar'} = 'This is bar';
$foo{'baz'}{'foo'} = 'This is foo, stored under baz in %foo';
$foo{'qux'} = 'This is qux';

print "The hash '%foo' looks like this:\n";
print Dumper(\%foo);
</pre>

When executed:
<pre>
The hash '%foo' looks like this:
$VAR1 = {
          'bar' => 'This is bar',
          'baz' => {
                     'foo' => 'This is foo, stored under baz in %foo'
                   },
          'qux' => 'This is qux'
        };
</pre>

Note that I passed Dumper() a reference to the 'foo' hash by using a backslash, which is what you will want most of the time with anything other than a scalar.  Passing a reference causes Dumper() to print the entire variable's contents in the same scope.  If you pass 'foo' directly, instead of its reference, you end up with this:
<pre>
The hash '%foo' looks like this:
$VAR1 = 'bar';
$VAR2 = 'This is bar';
$VAR3 = 'baz';
$VAR4 = {
          'foo' => 'This is foo, stored under baz in %foo'
        };
$VAR5 = 'qux';
$VAR6 = 'This is qux';
</pre>

Which doesn't make it clear that 'foo' is a hash.

BODY:
My dad made up a bunch of [dulce de leche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche) a while back; if you're going to boil one can, you might as well fill the pot.  For those who don't know, the easiest way to make dulce de leche, a caramelized milk product popular in South and Central America, is to boil a can of <em>sweetened</em> [condensed milk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk) for two to three hours.  At the shorter end of that range, you'll end up with viscosity similar to a caramel syrup; longer and it turns into a thick, spreadable paste, not unlike Nutella.

I have seen numerous references on the internet of people not wanting to boil a can for fear of it exploding, but this trepidation is unfounded - boiling is a normal part of the [canning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning) process.  The contents of the can are put in, the can is sealed and then it is brought to 100&#xB0;C or even hotter to sterilize the elements within.  Leaving a can in boiling water on the stove is perfectly safe, assuming the pan doesn't run dry, the water will keep the system, can included, from breaking the boiling point.  That's just basic [thermodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics).  As mentioned previously, it's worthwhile to boil a few cans at once, since the energy expenditure of keeping a pot simmering on the stove is nearly identical.

To make the ice cream, combine these ingredients and toss it into your ice cream maker:

<pre>
1 can sweetened condensed milk
1 can dulce de leche
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups milk
Vanilla to taste (1-3 teaspoons)
</pre>

I used thick (3 hour) dulce de leche, which lends a very strong flavor and skim milk, because it was in the fridge.  To get everything to combine, I had to stir it on the stove for about 10 minutes.  Don't just let milk sit on the stove unstirred, however; it grows a nasty skin quite quickly.  If you don't have another can of sweetened condensed milk, it can be replaced by another cup of cream, a half cup of milk and a cup of sugar.

BODY:
I stumbled across a [code golf](http://golf.shinh.org) earlier this week that offers numerous problems.  The specific challenge I came across was the [fizz buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizz_buzz) problem that I had been introduced to a few weeks ago.

My initial attempt in Perl was this:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    $a = "";
    $a = "Fizz" if !($_ % 3);

    if (!($_ % 5)) {
        $a .= "Buzz"
    } elsif ($_ % 3) {
        $a = $_
    }

    print "$a\n"
}
</pre>

Nothing special at all, just some fairly tight, clean code.  Aside from the broken apart `if` block and the use of bad variable names (`$a`, `$_`) it wouldn't look out of place in a normal program.  After exhausting my knowledge of esoteric Perl, I whittled it down to this:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    $a = ($_ % 3) ? "" : "Fizz";
    $a .= "Buzz" if !($_ % 5);

    $a ||= $_;

    print "$a\n"
}
</pre>

With a bit of digging, I found that I could use the `+` and `,` operators as part of `print` to get rid of that `$a` assignment:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    $a = ($_ % 3) ? "" : "Fizz";
    $a .= "Buzz" if !($_ % 5);

    print + $a || $_, "\n"
}
</pre>

But you certainly don't need most of the parenthesis, and Perl deals with barewords just fine:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    $a = $_ % 3 ? "" : Fizz;
    $a .= Buzz if !($_ % 5);

    print + $a || $_, "\n"
}
</pre>

Finally, after reading through [`perlvar`](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html) I found that the input record separator, which defaults to "\n", can take the place of that four-character newline:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    $a = $_ % 3 ? "" : Fizz;
    $a .= Buzz if !($_ % 5);

    print + $a || $_, $/
}
</pre>

101 characters, but you can go a step further, drop the $a assignment and condense those statements down below:
<pre>
for (1..100) {
    print + ($_ % 3 ? "" : Fizz) . ($_ % 5 ? "" : Buzz) || $_, $/
}
</pre>

Finally, since this is now a single Perl statement, the curly braces can be eliminated by placing the loop control at the end (thanks to Fotios for that tip).  After you beat the whitespace out, you end up with 56 characters:
<pre>
print+($_%3?"":Fizz).($_%5?"":Buzz)||$_,$/for(1..100)
</pre>

If you work with large files, in particular large markup documents vim's folding feature can make your day a whole lot better.  Just like the fancy folding that IDEs like Eclipse and Visual Studio provide, vim can reduce whole sections of text to a single line making it easy to skip around and keep your attention focused on what is important.  There are a number of different methods that vim can automatically figure out where to fold your file but I've found that `indent` does what I want most of the time.  To turn folding on and off easily, I wrote the following function in my `~/.vimrc`

<pre>
set foldmethod=indent
set nofoldenable
function ToggleFolding()
    if &foldenable
        set nofoldenable
    else
        set foldenable
    endif
endfunction
</pre>

I bound this to &#60;F2&#62; with the following:

<pre>
nmap <silent> &#60;F3&#62; :call ToggleFolding()&#60;CR&#62;
</pre>

You can open and close folds using `zo` & `zc` and jump between them with `zk` & `zj`.

BODY:
An important and often-overlooked part of programming is profiling of code to find out where the most time is being spent and then figuring out how the resulting sections of your program can be improved.  This aspect of writing code gets little attention from people writing user-bound applications because generally, computers are fast enough that even atrocious code can complete before the user is ready to respond.  Despite this fact execution speed is still important, especially in data processing code such as that which parses large datasets (which I often find myself doing) or converts videos, for instance.  If your code consists of a number of nested loops, you can probably benefit from profiling it and speeding up the most oft-used pieces.  Even if that doesn't apply, timing the execution of statements will certainly improve your understanding of which operations are fast and which drag you down.

The very simplest form of profiling code is using manually activated timers.  In Perl, this is accomplished with the `Benchmark::Timer` module as follows:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
use strict;
use warnings;

use Benchmark::Timer;
my $timer = Benchmark::Timer->new();

$timer->start('overall');

$timer->start('single');
sleep 5;
$timer->stop('single');

$timer->start('loop');
for (my $x = 0; $x < 5; $x++) {
    sleep 1;
}
$timer->stop('loop');

$timer->stop('overall');

print "The single 'sleep' took " . $timer->result('single') . " seconds.\n";
print "The 'sleep' loop took " . $timer->result('loop') . " seconds.\n";
print "Overall, this took " . $timer->result('overall') . " seconds.\n";
</pre>

Which, when run, produces something like the following output:
<pre>
~$ ./foo.pl
The single 'sleep' took 5.002198 seconds.
The 'sleep' loop took 5.020094 seconds.
Overall, this took 10.022404 seconds.
</pre>

Easy and quick.  Next time, Devel::DProf.

<p>Devel::Profile is probably sufficient for your needs. No modification of code is necessary, and you get a breakdown of time spent and counts for each function.</p>

Almost every time I get into my Mom's car, I find that the radio is coming from the front-right speaker only.  You see, she has an Acura TL which has a stereo that features two main knobs.  Pushing the left knob turns it on or off and turning it adjusts the volume.  The right knob is used for tuning the radio but can also adjust output characteristics (bass, treble, fade and balance) which are cycled through by pushing the knob.  It seems that when attempting to tune the radio she may accidentally push in the knob causing any further turning of said knob to adjust the bass and treble to full and shift the sound all the way to the right side, front most speaker.  This isn't her fault; she's driving and ought to be able to easily fumble with the radio to make adjustments without looking down.  This is a case of bad user interface design.

BODY:
After my mom had decided that her new car would be a BMW 535i, I proposed to my parents that they might like to check out BMW's European Delivery program.  Through ED, you work with a US dealer to buy the car and get a 7% price break having to do with taxes and legal mumbo jumbo; it works out to be a good way to subsidize a vacation to Europe.  My parents asked if I'd be interested in coming along and so we planned a trip centered, in my mind, around the Formula 1 race in Magny-Cours and visiting the Nurburgring.

We arrived in Munich in the morning and went outside to get a taxi to the BMW European Delivery center.  Outside was a lineup of cream-colored cars, mostly Mercedes E-class wagons and R-class MPVs.  A 220d E-class pulled up, we loaded our bags and proceeded towards Munich.  The drive along the motorway was fun because, in addition to reaching upwards of 160 Km/h, I saw numerous cars that I had previously only heard about on *Top Gear*.  At the European Delivery center, we were told that the car would take about 45 minutes to prepare.  We walked upstairs to the cafe and had some coffee and German snacks.  This will be the only time that the word "snacks" will be what Americans understand to be a small or partial meal; throughout the rest of the trip, it seemed that what Germans call a snack most others would call a good lunch.  Also, in Germany, what looks to be a croissant probably has eggs and ham inside.  These items are tasty.

After waiting a spell, we walked around the lot outside checking out the numerous diesel and 1-series cars that never make it to the US.  We headed back inside to wait a bit more and after about an hour and a half someone approached with the papers to sign over the car.  He explained to us the insurance that came with it (which is all the coverage you need, it seems) and go over other paperwork.  We then headed to the garage to get a quick rundown of the car's features.  After hearing about how many horsepowers [sic] the car has, we loaded our luggage into the 5er's trunk, which is significantly larger than that of either of my parents' current cars, a Volvo S80 and Acura TL.  Once loaded, we bid "auf wiedersehen" to the friendly Germans and my dad makes his way through the unnecessarily small garage door and we are on our way to driving the car, which had only 1 mile on the odometer, through Europe.

We headed towards the Bavarian Alps where we would spend our first night in a small town named Ettal, home to a magnificent monastery which, of course, brews the local beer.  After sitting down for a late lunch with a half-liter of the aforementioned beer we walked to the far end of town, which took all of 5 minutes.  We hopped back into the car at that point and took a short drive to neighboring towns to explore a few churches and pick up some bottled water.

I got an [automatic ice cream machine](http://www.cuisinart.com/catalog/product.php?product_id=313&item_id=422&cat_id=10) as a graduation gift recently and, because it's so easy, I've been making tons of the stuff.  All thats involved is whipping together a mix, tossing it into the bucket and turning the dial; no need to fool with ice and because it's compressor-driven, you can create one batch right after the other without needing multiple frozen cores.  This allows me to easily create a number of slightly different mixes in order to find the best possible recipe for a superb ice cream.  Everyone loved a peanut butter flavored masterpiece I made a few weeks ago, so I figured that'd be a good thing to start with.

I made three batches as follows; each batch contained a couple of tablespoons of vanilla in addition to that listed below:

<table border="0" cellspacing="10">
	<tr>
		<td><b>Peanut butter</b></td>
		<td><b>Sugar</b></td>
		<td><b>Light cream</b></td>
		<td><b>Skim milk</b></td>
		<td><b>Skim milk Powder</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1/2 cup</td>
		<td>1/4 cup</td>
		<td>1/2 cup</td>
		<td>1/2 cup</td>
		<td>-</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1/2 cup</td>
		<td>1/4 cup</td>
		<td>3/4 cup</td>
		<td>3/4 cup</td>
		<td>-</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1/2 cup</td>
		<td>1/4 cup</td>
		<td>3/4 cup</td>
		<td>3/4 cup</td>
		<td>1/4 cup</td>
	</tr>
</table>

All of these were very good.  The one with equal amounts of peanut butter and the two milk products was perhaps a little bit too much like eating gobs of peanut butter; the other two were much more like actual ice cream.  Skim milk powder, often an ingredient in ice cream recipes, is the only difference between the two with more milk and it had a small but beneficial effect.  I think it would work best to have a 2:1 ratio of total liquid milk (cream & milk) to milk powder; 3/4 cup would be better than the 1/4 cup I used, in this case.  All of the ice creams were sweet enough, in my opinion, and perfectly creamy, due in large part to the fat of the peanut butter.  I tend to make fairly lean ice creams, so if you want something even more luscious, which seems to be how most ice cream recipes are written, go with whole milk instead of skim or use a heavier cream.

If you're trying to setup a proxy on Apache2 in Ubuntu Feisty, by default it disallows all access to any proxy URLs, which is good.  What isn't good, however, is that nowhere I could find mentioned that this could be found in the `proxy.conf` file located in `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled`.  I spent some time wondering why my Allow and Deny orders were being ignored until I looked at this file and found that it has the final say.  To allow access to your proxy, you must edit this file adding 'Allow' orders within the `<proxy *>` block.  Simply use hostnames, IP addresses or [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation:

<code><pre>

If you're using the Oracle apt repository (`deb http://oss.oracle.com/debian/ unstable main non-free`) with Ubuntu or a recent version of Debian and don't have their GPG key, you'll get the following error when running `apt-get update`:

<code><pre>
W: GPG error: http://oss.oracle.com unstable Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 2E2BCDBCB38A8516
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
</pre></code>

To fix this, you need to add Oracle's key to apt, which is straightforward, if you can find the key.  After some searching, I found it at http://oss.oracle.com/el4/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle; to import this, run the following:

<code><pre>
sudo wget http://oss.oracle.com/el4/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle -O- | sudo apt-key add -

Everyone has used Windows and at some point in time has tried to open up a file for which they didn't have a reader installed and got that dialog that offers to find a suitable program to view the file.  This dialog is worthless and has never lead anyone to finding the program that they need.

I created a spreadsheet on my office using Gnumeric the other day and brought it home to look at.  When I went to open it on my Feisty machine at home, I was greeted by the "Add/Remove Applications" application which offered to install Gnumeric Spreadsheet in order to open the file.  Very automatic, easy and very cool.  These are the sorts of things that really make Linux a great option for desktop users.

A Google search for 'malted milk ice cream' only turns up a single recipe, that from [A Perfect Scoop](http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments/dp/1580088082/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8039568-6832620?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181954898&sr=8-1).  I used that as the basis for my ice cream but only very loosely.  I've been cooking long enough what changes can be made to a recipe without screwing it up completely and so took the liberty of omitting the eggs.  I usually make ice cream without eggs mainly because I'm lazy and if you use eggs you have heat your mixture to cook them.  Also, without eggs ice cream is considerably healthier, containing much less fat and cholesterol.  Finally, ice cream made with eggs is technically a custard.  That final stipulation is the one I pull out when I don't want people to think I'm lazy.  My recipe is as follows:

<pre>
1.5 cups half & half
1.5 cups whole milk
1 cup malted milk
1/2 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup sugar
1.5 teaspoons vanilla
</pre>

I use more vanilla and malted milk because I really like those flavors.  The amount of vanilla is perfect, but if you're not into the malt as much, you should first ask yourself why you are making malted milk ice cream and then only use 1/2 or 2/3 of a cup.  I used whole milk and half & half in the quantities specified because I wanted 3 cups of liquid total and that's how much half & half I had that needed to be used up.  The original recipe calls for cream, as many ice cream recipes do; this will certainly make a more luscious ice cream, but I've found whole milk + half & half to do a fine job.  My normal ratio is 1 cup half & half and 2 cups milk, which makes a very good ice cream with much less fat than cream-based ice cream.  I guess I really am making ice milk, but no matter, it's good stuff.

BODY:
If you've ever used a Sun workstation, you know the joys of having a control key where most keyboards position the caps lock key.  If you're an experienced user of the Interweb, you know that there is nary an occasion that calls for the caps lock.  The fact that you have to hold down the shift key is a good moment to reconsider any yelling.  Though I don't use the console often, it is endlessly annoying to find that I don't have a <em>properly</em> positioned control key when I do.  I went searching for the right way to change the keyboard's layout, since I hadn't ever bothered to do it previously.  I found [this](http://www.vollink.com/gary/deb_ctrlcaps.html) how-to by Gary Vollink which describes how to replace the worthless caps lock with the useful control key in all operating systems anyone ever uses.

For Ubuntu's console, it's a simple change in `/etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz`, which can be edited directly with `vi`; no need to un-gzip it first.  Keycode 29 is the left control key and #58 is the caps lock.  If you want another control, just copy the contents of 29 to 58 and if, for some reason (lots of SQL?) you care to swap the two rather than be rid of caps lock entirely, simply swap the values after the equals signs.

In X, I had previously used Gnome's keyboard preferences to change the caps lock setting, but the above-mentioned howto showed that it could be done by adding the following option to the 'InputDevice' section of one's `xorg.conf`:

<pre><code>
Option		"XkbOptions"	"lv3:ralt_switch, ctrl:nocaps"
</code></pre>

<p>I personally like to map the escape key to my caps lock key so I don't have to reach for it when editing in vim. I don't know how your key bindings are setup, but I tend to use the control key much less than escape or alt.</p>

<p>You can also remap the keys with xmodmap on a per-user basis by adding the following to ~/.Xmodmap:</p>

<p>! Switch caps lock and (left) control
remove Lock = Caps<em>Lock
remove Control = Control</em>L
keysym Control<em>L = Caps</em>Lock
keysym Caps<em>Lock = Control</em>L
add Lock = Caps<em>Lock
add Control = Control</em>L</p>

<p>and executing 'xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap'</p>

<p>One small comment:
I had to substitute "CapsLock" with "Caps<em>Lock" and "ControlL" with "Control</em>L".</p>

<p>Other than that the way you've described in your comment works great for me!</p>

This trick also works on debian squeeze. If console-setup isn't installed, which it won't be be default, the keymap is located at /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz and is loaded by /etc/init.d/keymap.sh as one of the first actions at boot time.

Interestingly, doing this didn't interfere with .Xmodmap swapping the keys. It continued to work correctly. But now the capslock light on the keyboard is correct in X, whereas before the light would toggle when hitting the 'esc' key (the old capslock) even though it didn't have any effect. And hitting "capslock" (the old esc) wouldn't toggle the light, but would change the caps state.

Now the light is correct in X or console.

I just switched the number '1' with the number '58', after examining the format of the file. Running "/etc/init.d/keymap.sh start" made changes take effect immediately.

Just don't ever, ever swap keys on a keyboard that is not yours and yours alone. Granted that the Caps Lock key is a worthless piece of junk, but the fact is that the rest of the typing world has a mental map expecting the Control key to be at the lower-left corner of the keyboard. Expecting others to change is reminiscent of walking into a timeshare terminal room and seeing Dvorak keyboards throughout.

BODY:
On our second day in Europe, the first destination was [Neuschwanstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein), the castle which served as the inspiration for [Sleeping Beauty Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_Castle) in Disneyland.  First, though, we had to get some breakfast.  Upon greeting the inkeeper, we were told of the breakfast options, "Hungry?  Ja, you will have muesli."  In addition to muesli atop some very good yogurt there was a spread of meats and cheeses that would become standard over the next few days.

After breakfast and a short walk around the monastery, the first of many churches, we hopped into the 5 and headed toward Austria which we would skip through on our way to the castle.  After a fairly uneventful drive along some motoroways and a stop in at a tourist info center, we came upon the road that, from looking at the map, seemed to be the best route to Neuschwanstein.  Though it meandered through a valley next to a beautiful blue-green [Plansee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plansee), this road turned out to be a somewhat undesirable avenue to the schlo&#x00DF;.  Most Americans are aware that smaller cars rule in Europe and being there only reinforces this fact.  A 5 series is a sizable vehicle, but certainly not "large" by US standards; in Europe, however, I couldn't imagine having to drive anything larger.  The road that we had chosen was two car widths wide, but only barely.  With my right wheels centimeters from the edge of the road (and wooden posts only a decimeter or so from said edge), the wing mirrors of cars passing in the other direction were no more than a hand-width from my own.  In a brand-new car, this is not a relaxing time.  In time, though, I became accustomed to this because of the much greater skill of European drivers.  Generally, you don't have to drive as though everyone around you is incompetent, unlike here in America.

We got to the castle and had to take a vigorous hike up a few kilometers of mountain to reach the castle.  Such a tourist attraction wouldn't survive in the US; Americans won't walk up a hill, they would demand motorized transport.  It was a good walk and lead to some wonderful views from the castle and impressive works within.

After leaving Neuschwanstein, we had to make our way to France for the Formula 1 race the next day.  We hopped in the car and headed West, stopping at a supermarket in Austria to pick up some bottled water.  I mention the water because after studying the numerous varieties we bought two six packs, one marked "Naturel" and the other "Stille."  Turns out the latter has bubbles and the former doesn't, which was opposite our expectations.

When we arrive at our bed and breakfast in [Puligny-Montrachet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puligny-Montrachet) the  innkeeper informed us that the nice restaurant would be full since we were there so late, but if we didn't mind something "not so fancy," there was a place just a kilometer walk down the road.   Upon arriving at the restaurant we found that it was not far from fancy at all and served a wonderful meal including a final cheese course.  Very French and very, very good.

So, if you come from the world of Perl, like I do, you're probably very familiar with the usage of regular expressions to match (m/(foo)bar(baz)/) and replace (s/foo(bar)/baz$1/) strings.  `sed` acts upon lines and often you want to delete a range of lines.  For the following regex, I had a document something like this:

<code> </code>
<pre>&lt;Recording modeType="foo"&gt;
    &lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;
    &lt;baz&gt;qux&lt;/baz&gt;
&lt;/Recording&gt;
&lt;Recording modeType="fp"&gt;
    &lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;
    &lt;baz&gt;qux&lt;/baz&gt;
&lt;/Recording&gt;
&lt;Recording modeType="bar"&gt;
    &lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;
    &lt;baz&gt;qux&lt;/baz&gt;
&lt;/Recording&gt;</pre>
...and I wanted to remove any of the blocks of `modeType` 'fp'.  To do so, I tell `sed` to find lines with the `modeType` of 'fp', and a subsequent line with a closing 'Recording' tag and then 'd'elete them all:

`sed -i -e '/modeType="fp"/,/Recording&gt;/d'`

Simple.  The more you get to know it, the more awesome `sed` is.

While reading the [Wikipeidia](http://en.wikipedia.org) page on [adhesive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive) I came across this nugget of wisdom on food decomposition:

<blockquote>Another example is when someone tries to pull apart Oreo cookies and all the filling remains on one side. The goal in this case is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.</blockquote>

Apparently, when you're trying to break apart an [Oreo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo) and get all the filling to stay on one side, say, to make a quad-stuf (yep, [only one 'f'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo#Varieties)) Oreo, you are hoping for an adhesive or interfacial failure, that is, a failure of the adhesive (white, corn-syrupy goodness) where it meets the adherent (black cookie piece).

Also, for another barely-related angle is [this page](http://massmma.net/readMore.php?id=245) from a UFC forum discussing the caloric content of foods someone mentions their method of making Oreos less bad for you:

<blockquote>i just want everyone to know this lil diet trick i use to cut calories out of my double stuff oreos, if you take 2 of them apart and make 1 quad stuff oreo you eliminate 2 of the chocholat cookies there for cutting out calories while you enjoy a nice diet quad stuff oreo</blockquote>

Though I'd say the perfect ratio of filling to cookie is somewhere between 2 and 3 to one, I often make quad-stuf monsters.

It's not often that I praise any of the American auto manufacturers, least of all Chevrolet.  This isn't because I'm a European car fanboy or otherwise prejudiced against American cars but simply because they [churn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Five_Hundred) [out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala) [so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Aztek) [much](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Neon) [crap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile).  The chronic problem for manufacturers is that of  [least-common-deonminator, good-enough, penny-pinching engineering](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html).

Though I'm a little bit behind the ball, Chevy [announced](http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/06/chevy-introduces-hhr-panel/) that they would be making a panel-van version of their retro-styled [HHR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_HHR) mini-SUV; this is the first good idea to come out of the C-shop in a long time.  Small businesses have needs to transfer things just like larger ones.  Plumbers and contractors have a reason to have a [full-size van](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Econoline), since they want to carry around a lot of tools and spare parts.  If you're not into construction, however, that's a bit much.  Beyond being more vehicle than you want to buy and getting terrible gas mileage, it's difficult to park and maneuver.  Sure, you can get a minivan for your small business but that leaves you little area to put logos and it's also too low, down below the windows.  Furthermore, a minivan is still often more space than is necessary.  So you could look at small hatchbacks such as the [Mazda 3]() or [Honda Accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord) which are nice, but a little bit too small and still offer little space for advertising on the outside.

The HHR is just the right size; it's Goldilocks' preferred size, providing enough room to care somewhat bulky items (flowers, small catering gear, computers), a few cubbys for tools and some good space for plastering a logo on the outside.  I really think this is perfect for small business like florists, computer support and even someone like Charm City Cakes, who are often on Food Network transporting a wedding cake in a huge Econoline van.

BODY:
Perl is a great language for web programming and one of the features that makes it well suited is *Taint Mode*.  Perl's Taint Mode, quite simply, restricts what the programmer can do with variables that are acquired from user input.  If a programs relies on the user to specify something, it's a bad assumption to treat those values as safe for use in operations that may affect the outside world, such as opening files and using tainted values in `system()` calls.  Perl wont restrict you from using tainted values in innocuous things such as print statements but it does pass taintedness on to other variables that a tainted value touches.  Furthermore, modules such as DBI support recognizing taintedness of variable for safety.

The following is from Greenhouse's *Palabras*, which I have on the album *Skarmageddon 3* but, as I just found on Amazon, is on their own album, [Tomorrow The World](http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-World-Greenhouse/dp/B000006AUS/ref=pd_bbs_3/105-7333297-0074842?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1184553769&sr=1-3).

	Now in a cup dissolve two bags of yeast
	Let it stand and then proof and diffuse
	Get a cup of sugar, of flour 4
	Mix it up and let it stand some more

	Get the greasy pan, oil top the dough
	Let it rise and when...
	Give it 25 minutes, 400 degrees
	Some times I cut it up and eat blue cheese

Five Iron Frenzy has a very good song entitled *Rhubarb Pie*, though it fails to give a recipe for the desert.

<pre>
Well lately I've been thinkin'
about some good home cookin',
just like that I haven't eaten'
in the longest time.
Now I like potato chips,
please don't get me wrong.
But I haven't tasted mama's rhubarb pie in so very long.

Rhubarb pie, in the summer.
Rhubarb pie, made by my mother.
Nothing better in the winter,
than rhurbarb pie after dinner.

Twinkes may be better,
than a hole in the sweater,
and a hole in the sweater,
beats a poke in the eye.
If I had my choice,
I'd leave this gas station store.
And then I'd travel back in time,
and I'd sit down and have some more.

Rhubarb pie, in the summer.
Rhubarb pie, made by my mother.
Nothing better in the winter,
than rhurbarb pie after dinner.

Looking at the picture,
in the Sunday paper,
of the politician, he's talkn' to the press.
He looks like he's been eating lemons all his life.
Well I think mama's rhubarb pie
could save solve more problems overnight.

Searching for some numbers to go along with Bush's final State of The Union address, I stumbled across [this piece](http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6675) by the oddly-named [Drum Major Institute](http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6675).  Their rebuttal covers the main points that were made presented with quotes from the speech alongside the DMI's official riposte sound byte.  Furthermore, the institute provides more in depth dissection of their position with (select) numbers to back up their retort.  Being a biased response, the commentary doesn't fully explore each issue, but that's not to say it's anything like [Fox News biased](http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1067).

The specific statistic I was searching for after hearing [Robert Siegel](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101185) or [David Welna](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1934700) (I'm so old-school I listened to it on the radio) mention that Bush's $18b cut of so-called useless programs from the federal budget was really a small change.  Indeed it is, as the proposed federal budget is $2.9 trillion for 2008, making Bush vaunted cuts a mere .6%.

Though I think the DNC's goal of halting the ever-earlier progression of primaries is a righteous one, their execution of it is royally stupid.  By stripping Florida and Michigan of their delegates, thereby marginalizing the voters in those states the DNC has made campaigning in the states during primary season worth very little.  Indeed the democratic front runners all signed a pledge not to campaign in Florida in order to further shun the state for [moving it's primary election earlier](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18783378/).  The candidates are missing a vital opportunity to court Florida voters and bring them to the democratic party.  Sure, the nominee isn't decided yet, but we know who the possibilities are; shouldn't they be allowed to endear voters toward themselves?

As I said above, I do agree with the DNC goal of ceasing the one-up-manship that states are participating in, each trying to get their primary to be the first.  Super Tuesday this year is during the first week in February, the same week that [the New Hampshire primary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_primary#Winners_and_runners-up) was held in 2000.  Primary season will be all but complete in 2008 at the time it was just beginning only 2 elections ago.

BODY:
The Data Loss of the Week award goes to [GE Money](http://www.gemoney.com), the credit card processing company used by [JC Penny](http://www.jcpenny.com) department stores, who lost information on 650,000 customers including social security numbers for 150,000 of those.  The information was on a backup tape that was stored in a warehouse of [Iron Mountain](http://www.ironmountain.com/index.asp) and went missing last October.  Of course, the company reported that there was no reason to suspect the data was stolen nor used fraudulently.  Mike mentions that, like most lost data incidents, a year of free credit monitoring will probably be given to the victims.  Emmanuel wonders whether those given the credit monitoring service will be automatically billed for it after the year is up.  Bernie S. uses a service after [TD Ameritrade lost his information](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004100554_btdatabreaches31.html) 3 months ago.  He said that they did not take any billing information, so wouldn't be able to charge him without his knowledge and likens it to the [Do Not Call List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Do_Not_Call_Registry), which is often abused by unscrupulous telemarketers.  The [Identity Theft Resource Center](http://www.idtheftcenter.org/) says that there was a 6 fold increase in the number of compromised records last year, a total of 125 million in 2007.

Emmanuel goes on a long tirade about his Verizon land-line phone bill, complaining about the charge for "Verizon Freedom Essentials," which includes call-waiting ID, and anonymous call rejection, which is free.  The big complaint is something marked as "discounted telecommunications service" which, though it sounds like a good and normal thing, is actually the name of a company, that charged him for directory assistance at a rate of $8.50 per instance.  In order to get the charge removed, Emmanuel says the best tactic is to claim that the line is connected to a fax machine and that there is no way he could have made a call.  A tangential discussion about the exorbitant cost and low quality of directory assistance leads Bernie to divulge his method of getting good advice for an area he knows little about: he simply calls a random number in the [NPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbering_plan) and prefix that he is looking for information about.  With a bit of social engineering, most people will recommend a business that suits your needs.

A North Dakota judge decided that [performing a zone transfer is illegal](http://www.circleid.com/posts/811611_david_ritz_court_spam/) if you don't obtain authorization first.  Bernie likens it to what he was arrested for, possessing equipment for the modification of telecommunications instruments for the unauthorized access to telecommunications services.  His appeal was based upon the fact that the law didn't specify who would give authorization for such modifications.  Though a similar case, Mike clarifies that performing a [zone transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer), getting all of the host in a domain, is trivial, requiring no special equipment and only common software.  Furthermore, DNS servers can be easily setup  to deny zone transfer requests.  The same judge also said that compiling 'whois' lookups without permission from [Network Solutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Solutions) is also illegal.

The head of the European Union's privacy regulators declared that IP addresses should be treated as personal information.  Though Google and others maintain that an IP address only identifies a computer, the EU commissioner said that because most people use the same computers repeatedly, it was still personal information.

[The Church of Scientology](http://www.xenu.net) was DDOSed  by "Anonymous" last week orchestrated as [Project Chanology](http://www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology) as a coordinated attack against Scientology.  This is in response to a recent video of Tom Cruise which the Church of Scientology forced YouTube to take down.  [Gawker still has the video up](http://gawker.com/5002269/the-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientology-tried-to-suppress), a good example of the [Streisand Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect), which goes unmentioned on the show.

Time Warner has announced that it will [start using usage-based billing](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9057739&intsrc=news_ts_head), which Emmanuel likens as, "people who use the internet more will pay more and people who use it less will pay the same."  Bernie notes that Time Warner and Comcast both kick people off of their "unlimited" services if they cross a certain threshold of usage surmising that they don't publish the limit because it would conflict with the advertising of the service as unlimited.

The [Federal Energy Regulatory Commision](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/61271.html) approved cyber-security standards to protect electrical utilities from attacks by hackers.  A group representing electricity generators, the [Edison Electric Institute](http://www.eei.org) recommended the standards, "following growing concerns about the security of utilities."  A senior CIA analyst, Tom Donahue, [is quoted as saying](http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20080119/tc_pcworld/141564;_ylt=ApT47f2sq03eNm7bFHH2Kg.DzdAF), "hackers literally turned out the lights in multiple cities after breaking into electrical utilities and demanding extortion payments before disrupting the power."  He refused to elaborate about where, when or how long the outages lasted only that they were outside the United States.  A video from last year, the Aurora Generator Test, blew this out of proportion last year showing [simulated hackers causing a generator to explode](http://www.nationalterroralert.com/updates/2007/09/26/video-shows-simulated-hacker-attack-of-power-grid/).

[A cocaine vaccine](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3804741.stm) was announced; Emmanuel and notkevin up the Orwellian implications such as parents giving it to their children which is an admission that their children might try cocaine in the future.

[Sprextel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Nextel) and [T-Mobile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile) were denied hearing of a case by the supreme court dealing with an [11th circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eleventh_Circuit) decision that would force them to add taxes into the pricing of their plan, rather than listing them separately.

[Cellphones were used to steal merchandise at a WalMart](http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/0-0&fp=479af84ee9af3fb3&ei=sziaR82ZHYvaywTPkZypAw&url=http%3A//www.newsday.com/news/local/crime/ny-lishop0123%2C0%2C6091381.story%3Fcoll%3Dny-lihistory-navigation&cid=0&sig2=NAyTSnRaW4tg9PaX4M74EA) on Long Island.

[FBI wiretaps were halted](http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/stories/2008/01/10/fbi_0111.html) after the bureau failed to pay bills on their lines.  Bernie brings up the incredible cost of wiretaps, stating that a single wiretap can cost more than $10,000 which all comes out of taxpayers pockets.

[Untraceable](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0880578/), a soon to be released action film about internet snuff films, seems to advocate against net-neutrality.

A listener calls asking for a recommendation of an MP3 player that will also tune AM stereo and Bernie recommends the [Pogo RadioYourWay](http://www.pogoelectronics.com/radioyourway.html).

Redbird responds to a listener's question about anti-virus for smart phones, saying that it's really not necessary.

<p>Love these posts Drew :)</p>

<p>There was a talk at HOPE about security on smartphones, I thought it was interesting that people are starting to consider antivirus software for them. I think the fact that Redbird says it isn't necessary means that it is - by the time it can be developed, people will be taking advantage of the lackadaisical attitude toward it.</p>

<p>That DNS zone transfer ruling is complete bullshit. Zone transfers are included in the DNS RFC! What are they going to do next, tell us it is illegal to be assigned an IP from a DHCP enabled router? I'm sick of technologically ignorant people in positions of power making decisions like these. I hope the EFF jumps on board to appeal this one.</p>

<p>You're sure up late.</p>

<p>The zone transfer decision is the most gregarious example of lacking technical understanding I've heard of in quite a while.  It's the equivalent of leaving your underwear out on the lawn and claiming passersby should be barred from taking pictures of it.  The general rule for physical privacy on your property is that things visible from public land enjoy no right to privacy.  The same should apply to servers.</p>

<p>I'm no fan of religion, but at least most religions feint righteous goals; Scientology is nothing but a money-grubbing cult of idiots.</p>

Perl is my favorite language in part because of the fluidity with which regular expressions fit in.  To loop through a file grabbing content out of matching lines is absolutely trivial:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
my @found;
for my $line (<infile>) {
    # Match lines and capture 'jazz' and everything that follows
    if ( /match this (jazz.*)$/ ) {
        # Save the captured stuff in an array
        push @found, $0;
    }
}
</pre>

Most other languages make such matching more difficult and Java is one of them.  Like in Python, regular expressions must first be compiled before they can be used for matching.  This multi-step process is significantly more cumbersome and if I haven't dealt with it for any length of time, I have to look up the procedure.  Here's a quick rundown of the same matching from above, this time in Java:

<pre class="brush: java;">
String regex = "match this (jazz.*)$";
Pattern myPattern = Pattern.compile( regex );

Vector<string> found = new Vector();
String line = null;
while ( (line = infile.readLine()) != null ) {
    Matcher myMatcher = myPattern.matcher( line );
    if ( myMatcher.find() ) {
        found.add( myMatcher.group(1) );
    }
}
</pre>

That's a bit of a hassle.

BODY:
My friend Lex read my post on [Python's lack of switch statements](http://dinomite.net/archives/dictatorial-leadership-is-sometimes-the-best) and sent me a note that the normal method for implementing something along the lines of a `switch` in Python is to use a dictionary.  First, let's define some functions:

<pre class="brush: python;">
def fooFunc():
    print 'Got foo?'
def barFunc():
    print 'Not foo.'
def nomatch():
    print 'No function to speak of!'

string = 'foo'
</pre>

Now we can create a dictionary and just lookup the variable you want to switch upon:

<pre class="brush: python;">
# Make a dictionary and call it switch
switch = {
    'foo': fooFunc,
    'bar': barFunc
    }

# Find the string in the dictionary, thereby calling the function
switch[string]()
switch['bar']()

# Another way to do the dictionary lookup
switch.get(string, nomatch)()
switch.get('bar', nomatch)()
</pre>

Which will call the function in the switch dictionary, or call `nomatch` if none of the dictionary entries match.  Or create an anonymous dictionary and do it all at once, more like a traditional `switch`:

<pre class="brush: python;">
{
    'foo' : fooFunc,
    'bar' : barFunc
}[string]()
</pre>

<p>I've been using python extensively for the last couple of months for an independent study project, and I have to say - it isn't my favorite language.</p>

<p>Some things like excluding switch statements are just annoying, as are the iterators that don't contain a reference to the previous element in a structure. Others, like not doing implicit casting when trying to print, are just stupid. When I print a variable, I don't want to have to first cast it to a string. Even worse, having to call str(obj) instead of obj.str() just removes from the OO feel of the language. It is kind of icky. Yes, all these issues can be worked around if you apply your programming knowledge to work around the language, but languages are supposed to be tools. I don't want to have to add extra steps when I'm writing code just to bypass a language's refusal to implement things that I've come to expect as standard. (Enums are another example of something I sorely miss in python, a fake implementation of which also uses a dictionary.)</p>

<p>I know python's mantra is "explicit not implicit," but I like the syntactic sugar of ruby and even the ease in which perl allows you to do things without laying everything out. Working with python has just felt kludgy, and I'm not sure what all the hype is about.</p>

<p>Just my $.02 ;)</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I come from Perl, where we don't have switch statements either (kudos if you're already running 5.10 everywhere) but their omission doesn't really bother me.</p>

<p>I do, however, feel your pain in the lacking iterators and the breaking of OO conventions in a few aspects of Python.  Even though it sounds cliché, the whole whitespace as structure thing is quite annoying, too.  Kludgy does sound a bit right; though new languages always begin by being frustrating due to a lack of knowledge and then go on to be new and interesting, Python has returned back to frustrating for me, because of things similar to what you mentioned.</p>

<p>I agree.  I keep finding things that I hate about Python.
And you can use the (rather hackish) "foreach.. do &amp;&amp; {}" structure in Perl as a mostly-reasonable and well-documented work-around in Perl.  And, as noted above, even this is no longer necessary with more recent Perl's.</p>

<p>Not that I think Perl (or any other languages) is free of language demons, but omigod:  why on <em>earth</em> must i write a whole separate function for a switch-step???  I really believe too much boiler-plate destroys the flow and comprehension of a program.
I'm sure people honestly believe that this just aids debugging.  I say Rubbish:  this looks a lot more like a dictatorial hack because it was easier to push the work back to <em>every</em> python developer instead of making the language help do that work for you.</p>

<p>Well I agree that the lack of a switch construct does lead to some inconvenience however I feel that it's a matter of getting used to doing things in a new programming language.  I don't agree that this is a dictatorial hack meant to get away with doing more work as some of the features in Python are definitely harder to implement than a switch construct.  The reason for its omission is more likely due to certain linguistic concerns or something.  By the way I am in support of a traditional switch construct just that I don't agree with th statement that the good people working on Python is simply trying to get away with more work by not implementing it.</p>

Redbird mentions the [Intelius](http://www.intelius.com) database, a background check service, which will give you a persons date of birth before you have to pay.

The group discusses London's expansion of their automated congestion charging to tally high polluting vehicles as well.

Emmanuel plays a clip from a November 1999 show and discussion of the upcoming [Year 2000 Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K).  Emmanuel laments people who think that 1999 is the last year of the century or that 2000 is the first year of the new millennium.  Micro controllers that control municipal functions are brought up, in particular the [PDP-11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)s (not micro controllers) that control the release of sewage into the [East River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River) according to lunar cycles, which influence tides.

John McCain's economic advisor, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, was on [Wednesday's Marketplace](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/30/econ_advisors_holtz_eakin/) discussing the senator's economic strategy for the country.  In the interview, Holtz-Eakin said this of McCain:

<blockquote>
He is a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution. He saw President Reagan cut taxes within the context of budget discipline and controls on spending.
</blockquote>

He went on to say that McCain had seen the positive effects of Reagan's policies of lower taxes on the economy and that the senator supported such actions.

Excuse me?  Are we really still bringing up Reagonomics?  The [trickle-down economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics) championed by the Reagan administration is a contentious issue and its effects on the general populace, like that of all economic matters, is debatable.  One thing that isn't debatable, however, is the [size of the federal debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_by_U.S._presidential_terms).  To put it quite frankly: Republicans want to cut taxes and spend like there's no tomorrow.  Ideally such a policy should be a boon to the economy and yet there's no clear evidence for that being the case.  What such strategies do affect are programs like Social Security; the money for tax cuts has to come from somewhere and more often than not it is by marginalizing other Federal programs.  Don't get me wrong, I don't particularly care for Social Security but the fact of the matter is I pay into it and I want to get my money's worth.  As it stands, I may never see the 6% of my pay that goes toward the troubled fund.

BODY:
In attendance: Emmanuel, Bernie S, Mike, Redbird and Not Kevin.

Bernie mentions that [analog cell phone service (AMPS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System) will be shut off during the week of February 18th.

The entire crew makes note of their significant lack of sports knowledge in light of the upcoming Superbowl.  Emmanuel shows a surprising amount of knowledge, though he condemns this knowledge wishing he could replace it with useful information in his head.

The show is on [International Delete Your MySpace Account Day](http://bloggasm.com/january-30th-is-international-delete-your-myspace-account-day) and Emmanuel points to it as evidence of the power of blogging and wonders whether.  Redbird insists that Facebook is useful and MySpace is not, though he admits to possibly having a MySpace account.  He also brings up the [flaw in MySpace's private pictures](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/01/myspace_torrent), which allowed pictures marked private to be viewed by anyone.  Emmanuel longs for an antonymous version of Facebook where people create lists of enemies and Bernie says that someone named "Bell" had an online death-pool but was arrested and the site taken down.

[The Last Hope](http://www.hope.net) will be July 18-20th and more information will be on the website.

[Charter Communications](http://www.charter.com/Visitors/Home.aspx) accidentally deleted messages for 14,000 email accounts and claims the data is completely irrecoverable leaving all very surprised that Charter didn't have backups for the data.  Redbird is impressed that Charter didn't simply blame the loss on hackers.

Also not caused by hackers is the [Bermuda triangle of car problems](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/01/27/2008-01-27_empire_state_building_car_zap_mystery.html) around the Empire State building.  Purportedly connected to cars with keyless entry, including Emmanuel's [Smart Car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_(automobile)), a New York City towing company says that they have to move 10-15 cars in the neighborhood per day.  Usually, they claim, towing the car a few blocks away solves the problem.  Redbird notes that the radio transmitters on top of the building are powerful enough that they will interfere with all sorts of radio devices.

A woman was awarded [nearly the maximum sentence for her crime](http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/24/america/24sentence.php) after making light of her victim's death on a prison phone.  Bernie said that when he was a guest in Federal prison all calls were recorded and there are no provisions for private calls, even with one's attorney.

Bernie brings up [Qwest](http://www.qwest.com)'s refusal to participate in the NSA's warrant-less wiretaps over the past few years but mentions that they lost numerous Federal contracts because of this decision.

Estonia and Russia are in a conflict over the movement of a World War 2 memorial in Estonia.  Apparently the Russia government was not involved in attacks against Estonian government and business websites rather it was a young Estonian angered by his government's decision on the memorial.

The group discusses [Anonymous' Project Chanology](www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology) whose attacks have been successful in bringing attention to the cult of [Scientology](http://xenu.net).  Bernie relates a story from when he worked as an offset printer.  The owner of the business for which he worked was a Scientologist who tried to convert Bernie who was fired from the job after not joining the crazies.

Though Google [changed their algorithm](http://searchengineland.com/070125-230048.php) to reduce the incidence of Google Bombs, if you [search for](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=dangerous+cult&btnG=Search) "[dangerous cult](http://www.scientology.org)" the first hit is the website of The Church of Scientology.  In other news, the cast of Off The Hook is often equipped with [blank expression](http://www.2600.com/offthehook)s.

Jim is still recovering and is now in a nursing home.  His address is:
<blockquote>
Caton Park Nursing Home<br />
Attn: Jim Vichench<br />
1312 Caton Avenue, Rm. 312B<br />
Brooklyn, New York 11226<br />
</blockquote>
Bernie says that Jim can now read again but still has trouble writing.

A listener wrote in to say that he saw a `robots.txt` which made mention of significant fines and lawsuits for people using automated methods of grabbing websites.  The consensus is that one couldn't get sued for using `wget`, but given the [zone transfer decision](www.circleid.com/posts/811611_david_ritz_court_spam/) made recently, care should be used when using automated tools to grab websites.

Apparently OTH has a bunch of 80+ year old listeners.

<p>I really, really hope that this isn't the last HOPE. Even if the main organizers don't want anything to do with it after this year, I'm remaining optimistic that it will take a Phrack-like approach and be resurrected by those that don't want it to die. HOPE is different than other conferences, the topics they cover range from computer security to urban exploration to talks on the life of Alan Turing. I'll be sad if a con with that kind of coverage disappears.</p>

<p>I deleted my facebook account over the summer, and never created a myspace. I was talking to a friend about this last night, actually - social networking sites are blurring the lines of what is socially acceptable for a person to be able to learn about you. Different people feel differently about disclosing certain levels of information, and probably split up what they will tell others on a person-by-person basis. Social networking sites don't allow this level of control over your information - facebook, for example, doesn't have different levels of friends. I'm not a fan of services that remove my ability to control how my personal information is distributed, and thus fully support "Delete Your Myspace" day :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the transcript! I hope I'm one of the 80+ OTH listeners someday :)</p>

I have a [non-Apple keyboard](http://www.keyovation.com/c-2-ergonomic-keyboards.aspx) that doesn't have volume buttons of any kind, yet I find the ability to change the volume from the keyboard incredibly convenient.  System Properties' built-in keyboard shortcut manager doesn't support global shortcuts (I want to be able to change volume no matter what application is active), so I went in search of a solution and found [Spark](http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php), which fits the bill nicely.  Coupled with a few [Applescript scripts](http://bbs.applescript.net/viewtopic.php?pid=72265), I've got volume control tied to some function keys.

For those who need help with Applescript, simply open Script Editor (Applications > Applescript > Script Editor) where you can paste in those scripts to test them.  Alternatively, just save each one (minus the function definition) into files ending with ".scpt" and they will then open with Script Editor.

This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [13 February 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0208.html).

In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Not Kevin<br />
On the phone: Bernie S from Philadelphia, [Mitch Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman) from California

Another week of fundraising.

RIM's Blackberry service [had another outage](http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/02/11/Outage-knocks-BlackBerry-users-offline_1.html) between 3:30pm and 6pm on Monday but the company claims that no data was lost.

Not Kevin's Verizon Samsung phone went on the fritz and throwing it from a ten-story building didn't fix it.  Emmanuel reports that, upon trying to SMS Not Kevin after he obtained a new phone, receive a response stating that the phone was unreachable, even though it was on.

This week brought many news stories of persons crossing the United States border and [having their computers more than thoroughly inspected](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/02/us_customs_seiz.html) or even seized by [Department of Homeland Security](http://www.dhs.gov) or [U.S. Customs and Border Patrol](http://www.cbp.gov) employees.  The searches include confiscation of laptops and cellular phones, forcing users to divulge their passwords and in some cases wholesale copying of data of disks or SIM cards.  Emmanuel advocates United States citizens refusing these searches.  A number of blog posts on the web have suggested keeping a secondary account on your laptop with some fake data, in order to comply with the search request without actually divulging data.  Bruce Schneier still recommends [employing strong encryption techniques](http://www.schneier.com/essay-199.html) to protect your data.  Bernie S proposes the use of tiny memory cards, such as [MicroSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroSD), for storing ones data and hiding it when crossing the border.  The [EFF](http://www.eff.org) is [suing to stop the practice](http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=47090).

The Senate [voted on a bill](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00015) to give retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in [warrantles wiretapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy).  Noted votes are those of potential presidential candidates; John McCain voted YEA to grant immunity, Barack Obama voted NAY and Hillary Clinton was (strategically) not present for the vote.  The bill passed with 61 YEA votes, including all Republicans and [a number of Democrats](http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/002448.html).

Network neutrality has come up again as Barack Obama spoke about it in a podcast from two years ago.  Obama advocated the continuation of net neutrality, a de-facto policy that has been in existence since the beginning of The Internet.  The senator chastised cable and telephone companies for being against network neutrality and also spoke in support of increased competition in broadband access.  Much like her failure to vote in the above-mentioned issue, Hillary Clinton has been conspicuously silent about net neutrality, despite her numerous speeches covering technology issues.  John McCain is on the record against net neutrality instead leaving it to the market to decide; the problem with such a stance is the duopoly that most consumers are left with for high speed access.  Mike Huckabee is in favor of net neutrality, explaining his position with [an analogy involving trucks on a highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes).

Premiums for the hour:
<ul>
<li>$25 - Off The Hook t-shirt</li>
<li>$40 - DMCA coffee mugs; one white on black, one black on white; for coffee only</li>
<li>$50 - [TV B Gone](http://www.tvbgone.com/cfe_tvbg_main.php)</li>
<li>$75 - 2600 zippered hoodie; "2600" on front, "hacker" on back</li>
<li>$250 - Super TV B Gone; 100 meter range</li>
</ul>

A clip from February 15th, 1995, the day Kevin Mitnick was captured, is played.  Emmanuel discusses the situation surrounding Kevin at the time and his near-miss capture a few weeks prior.  [Phiber Optik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Abene) made an appearance discussing [Kevin Poulsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Poulsen)'s case.

Mitch relates a story of a TV crew following him around Paris, France as he walked around turning off TVs.

Emmanuel mentions the real-world protests of [Scientology](http://xenu.net) by "Anonymous"; in New York, [more than 200 people were present](http://gothamist.com/2008/02/11/nyc_scientology.php).  Another demonstration will take place on the 15th of March at Scientology sites throughout the world.

<p>Gah, telecom immunity pisses me off. I can't believe that passed, and I hope the public takes note of that vote when the elections roll around. I don't consider myself especially liberal, but I can't see how <em>anyone</em> would agree that the telecoms should have immunity. But then again, they don't send me campaign checks. Clinton not voting speaks just as loudly as if she had voted for the bill, just as her not speaking in support of net neutrality should count as her speaking against it. These issues affect everyone, and I honestly care way more about net neutrality than any other hot-button topic.</p>

<p>I'm not sure who I support, but I know it definitely isn't McCain or Clinton. Obama is almost winning my support just for his standpoint on net neutrality and his voting record.</p>

<p>I saw some hi-def videos of Anonymous' protest in LA - they did very well. The only part that was slightly disappointing was when one Scientologist offered to talk about his beliefs in a very casual and non-confronting manner, and a couple protesters got in his face. I don't agree with Scientology either, but there was no reason for them to do that when the guy was only offering peaceful discourse. Overall though, the protests are amazing! The whole thing is a lot better executed than I ever would have imagined a group of people from the Internet were capable of doing.</p>

<p>Thanks for summary and the links! Keep it up :)</p>

<p>A lot of news organizations have simply said that Hillary wasn't present at the vote, ignoring that, in all likelihood, her decision to not be present was entirely strategic, so that she can't be chastised for voting either way.  You're absolutely right that she would have voted in favor of immunity for the telecommunications companies; her campaign staff is simply smart enough to know that the majority of her supports oppose such a view and not voting is the best way for her to bow out.</p>

<p>I looked through the videos on YouTube of the LA protest and couldn't find any scientologists getting shouted down but it is bad that the protesters ganged up on him.  As Emmanuel said when the first internet attacks on Scientology were launched, silencing anyone's views, even if they don't agree with your own is not the way to go about things.  Everyone deserves to be able to speak, at least in our country.  Side note, whatever idiot decided the anti-scientology movement should be called "Anonymous" needs a kick in the teeth.  If you understand the actions of the Church of Scientology, it makes a bit of sense as the church viciously attacks anyone who speaks against them.  It's still an annoying way to refer to a groupe.</p>

<p>I'm glad I know that at least one person appreciates these synopsis!</p>

BODY:
Someone asked me questions about filesystems recently and, though I used to have a good handle on them, my knowledge has waned over the years.  I figured writing about filesystem internals was a good way to brush up on that knowledge.

This information applies generally to [UFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_File_System), FFS, [ext2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2)/[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3) and XFS.  [ReiserFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS) and [HFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System)([+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus)) employ B-trees for organization of file metadata rather than inode lists, so they are somewhat different.  [ZFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) is the tits and all of its shenanigans are handled differently.

At a low level, Unix filesystems are made up of three main pieces on the disk: a superblock, inodes and data blocks.  The superblock contains information about the filesystem: a magic number to identify the type, the size of the filesystem, free data blocks and other gross information.  After the superblock comes a list of inodes, each of which contains metadata about a file including the permissions, the number of links to the file, the file type (symlink, directory, etc.) and the datablocks that hold the actual file data.   Note the conspicuous lack of a filename in the inode; more on this later. The balance of the space on a partition is made up of those data blocks which hold the actual file data.

As mentioned previously, inodes only store metadata; the actual data is stored in one or more data blocks, the inode merely keeps a list of the blocks that contain the data for the file.  In ext2/3, each inode has 15 blocks that can each refer to a single data block, each of which is usually 1 kilobyte meaning that the maximum filesize on ext2 is 15 kilobytes...but that's certainly not true.  The 15 data-referencing blocks are actually allocated more intelligently than that.  The first 12 (0..11) are direct blocks, pointing to the first 12 blocks (kilobytes) of a file.  The 12th block is the indirect block; instead of pointing to data blocks that contain data, it points to a data block that contains a list of up to 2060 addresses of blocks that contain data.  Since a maximum filesize of (2060+12) 2072 kilobytes isn't sufficient for most peoples needs, the 13th block is doubly-indirect and the 14th is triply-indirect.  With all that indirection, the maximum filesize on ext2/3 is about 35 gigabytes, which ought to be enough for anyone.

So, when you want to read a file, the operating system first checks the metadata in the inode to ensure you have permission to access said file.  Assuming you do, data is pulled from the data blocks listed in the inode, with appropriate indirection depending upon the size of the file.

I mentioned previously that filenames are not part of the inode, which seems odd as the filename seems to be a type of file metadata.  The rub is that in POSIX systems a file can have multiple names; my home directory can be referred to as `/home/dinomite`, `/home/dinomite/.`, `/home/dinomite/bin/..` or a number of other names.  How is this handled and where are filenames actually put?  In directories.  A directory boils down to nothing more than a list of names and their associated inode numbers, which we refer to has a link, giving name to the system call `unlink` which most people refer to as delete.  When you refer to a file by name, the operating system starts at the root node (`/`), which is always inode number 2.  Beginning with the root directory listing, it matches filenames to inode numbers, cascading this lookup until it has found the file that you referenced.

The important thing mentioned in the previous paragraph is that filenames in a directory list are links to a file; each of those links is noted in the file's inode as the link count.  Whenever a file is given a name (either by being created or a hard link via `ln`), the link count is incremented; when a link is deleted, the link count is decremented.  When the link count reaches zero, the kernel releases those data block, unless the file is currently open.  In the latter case, the data blocks are freed when the file is closed.  This also lends insight into how undelete programs work and what computer people mean when they say deleting something doesn't actually get rid of the data on the disk.  When you delete a file, more properly known as unlinking it, the only thing that actually goes away is the data in the inode.  Until they are overwritten, the data blocks still contain the data prior to being deleted.  `fsck` works in a similar manner, searching for inodes that have positive link counts, but no references in directories.

Finally, there are symbolic links.  With a symlink, an inode is allocated and has its symlink bit set.  If the file pointed to by the symlink is 60 bytes or less, it is stored directly in the inode.  If its longer, the pointed-to file is stored in data blocks and they are pointed to by the inode in the normal fashion.  Note that symbolic links to not affect an inode's link count, hence broken links.

Top Gear did a [Man v. Machine segment](http://youtube.com/watch?v=MCyrDZmCijk) a few months ago pitting a Peugeot 207 against a couple of [traceurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour).  It was a very entertaining clip and showed some good parkour moves as well.  If you're interested in parkour, however, even more interesting is a short video on the site of the [Worldwide Jam street team](http://www.worldwidejam.tv/streetteam.1.parkour.html) about the [making of the Top Gear segment](http://www.worldwidejam.tv/topgear.parkour.jam.html).  Unsurprisingly, each shot was done separately, some of them with some stunt assistance such as mats.

Ron Paul is an internet celebrity in the realm of campaign fund raising and for good reason: his campaign has garnered $19.5 million in donations in the fourth quarter, $6 million of that on the December 16th anniversary of the [Boston Tea Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party).  The news media never fails to mention his internet popularity and the fact that the majority of his donations stem from the tubes that run the new world.  When I went to check out Ron Paul's website and that of some other candidates, I was intrigued.  Users who go to the [Super Libertarian's internet presence](http://www.ronpaul2008.com) are presented with a clean and informative site:

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ron_paul1.png' title='Ron Paul campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ron_paul1.png' alt='Ron Paul campaign web page' height='350' width='522' /></a>

Top and center is useful information, in this case the time until the upcoming caucus in Iowa and primaries in New Hampshire.  The site includes information about his fund raising effort, links to donate and a form for getting campaign update emails below the fold.  Visiting other campaign sites is a different story:

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/clinton.png' title='Hillary Clinton campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/clinton.png' alt='Hillary Clinton campaign web page' height='328' width='402'/></a>

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/obama.png' title='Barack Obama campaign web page'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/obama.png' alt='Barack Obama campaign web page' height='334' width='446'/></a>

When you visit the websites for [HIllary Clinton](http://www.hillaryclinton.com) or [Barack Obama](http://www.barackobama.com) you are asked for contact information before seeing anything substantive.  You have to fill out the form or click through to get to the candidate's website.  Thankfully, their websites send cookies; subsequent visits forgo the information garnering forms whether or not you put in anything.  But why put up this stumbling block?  Ron Paul's site is much more elegant; the form for signing up to get campaign information is still easy to get to, but it's not intrusive.

I woke up to find the entitled error in the `rsnapshot` logs on one of my machines, which occurred as it was trying to remotely backup, via SSH, another.  A quick search and reading through a number of threads revealed [this message](http://monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0207/msg02592.html) stating that this problem was encountered with a Linksys router involved.  Lo and behold, my home network was just switched to a Linksys BEFSR41 when the problem began.

I think the router may also be the culprit for the occasional "error establishing encrypted connection code -12192" that Firefox has been giving me since the switch.

BODY:
After reading [this article](http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/28/holy-shmoly-ruby-19-smokes-python-away/) comparing the new Ruby 1.9 to it's older version and Python, I thought it would be interesting to see how my preferred language, Perl, compares.  First, because my hardware is certainly different from the author of that post, I re-ran the Python and Ruby 1.9 tests:

<pre>
Python:
real    0m43.415s
user    0m41.455s
sys     0m0.132s

Ruby:
real    0m35.379s
user    0m33.722s
sys     0m0.112s
</pre>

I threw together some quick Perl:

<pre class="brush: ruby;">
sub fib {
    my $n = shift;

    if ( $n == 0 or $n == 1 ) {
        return $n;
    } else {
        return fib($n - 1) + fib($n - 2);
    }
}

for (0..35) {
    print "n=$_ => " . fib($_) . "\n";
}
</pre>

and ran it:

<pre>
Perl:
real    1m15.329s
user    1m9.188s
sys     0m0.364s
</pre>

That's impressive; Perl sucks at this recursive implementation of computing Fibonacci numbers.  Since I had the makings of a little suite of benchmarks, I implemented this test in C and Java:

C code:
<pre class="brush: cpp;">
#include <stdio.h>

int fib(int n) {
    if ( (n == 0) || (n == 1) )
        return n;
    else
        return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
} //fib

int main() {
    int x;
    for (x = 0; x < 36; x++) {
        printf( "n = %d => %d\n", x, fib(x) );
    } //for

    return 0;
}
</pre>

C timing:
<pre>
real    0m0.605s
user    0m0.564s
sys     0m0.000s
</pre>

Java code:
<pre class="brush: java;">
class Fib {
    static int fib(int n) {
        if ( (n == 0) || (n == 1) )
            return n;
        else
            return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
    } //fib

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 36; x++) {
            System.out.println( "n = " + x + " => " + fib(x) );
        } //for
    } //main
} //Fib
</pre>

Java timing:
<pre>
real    0m0.455s
user    0m0.412s
sys     0m0.012s
</pre>

It's very interesting to see the huge speed disparities in these languages, but remember, this was a single, very limited test; don't take these benchmarks as having any significant meaning.  Really, don't take them to mean much of anything, unless all you do is write lots of simple recursive code.

Python can't deal with empty code blocks, which may arise if you want to stub out a block but leave the implementation for later.  If you have one in your code, the interpreter will give the following error:

<pre class="brush: python;">
  File "foo.py", line 1
    if (foo == bar):
     ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
</pre>

In this case, you can use the `pass` operator which will do nothing but take up a line, resulting in the following code:

<pre class="brush: python;">
if (foo == bar):
    pass #TODO
else:
    print "nothing to do!"

A server of mine, Claudius, sent me a very polite, though unpleasant email early this morning
<pre>
from:		mdadm monitoring <root@dinomite.net>
to:			root@dinomite.net,
date:		Nov 28, 2007 6:25 AM
subject:	Fail event on /dev/md0:claudius

This is an automatically generated mail message from mdadm
running on claudius

A Fail event had been detected on md device /dev/md0.

Faithfully yours, etc.
</pre>

Ugh; that means one of the drives in RAID set on Claudius has failed.  I only run [RAID0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#Standard_levels) on the machine, so data loss isn't any issue unless the second drive gives up, too.  I try not to actively administer machines; I just get them setup in a solid state and then make use of them, no reason to waste time fiddling around.  I hadn't done anything of note with the machine in question in some time, so I wasn't even sure what the drive setup was, though `df` clears that up:

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/md0              5.5G  1.7G  3.6G  32% /
varrun                506M  116K  506M   1% /var/run
varlock               506M  4.0K  506M   1% /var/lock

devshm                506M     0  506M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/md1               68G   13G   54G  19% /home
/dev/hdd1              19G   13G  5.1G  72% /backup
tmpfs                 506M   18M  488M   4% /lib/modules/2.6.15-29-k7/volatile
</pre>

So, md0 is the root (/) filesystem and Claudius also has a second RAID device, md1, which supports the `/home` filesystem.  I used `mdadm --detail` to get some more information about `md0`:

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm --detail /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
        Version : 00.90.03

  Spare Devices : 0

           UUID : 16c480c4:6bbc2b89:189b2529:3af755b2
         Events : 0.16665869

    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       0        0        -      removed
       1       3       65        1      active sync   /dev/hdb1

       2       3        1        -      faulty   /dev/hda1
</pre>

So it thinks there's a problem with `/dev/hda1`, one of the two partitions that makes up this RAID device.  At this point, I recall that Claudius has three disks in it, a 20G (/backup) and two 80G, the latter two support both of the systems RAID devices, `md0` and `md1`.  The notice that mdadm sent me was only concerning `md0` which is odd, because `md1` spans both of those physical disks as well:

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm --detail /dev/md1
/dev/md1:
        Version : 00.90.03

   Raid Devices : 2
  Total Devices : 2

    Persistence : Superblock is persistent

    Update Time : Wed Nov 28 11:38:25 2007
          State : clean
 Active Devices : 2
Working Devices : 2
 Failed Devices : 0
  Spare Devices : 0

           UUID : 41d43030:23b3662d:c1c06634:4132ebc3

    Number   Major   Minor   RaidDevice State
       0       3        2        0      active sync   /dev/hda2
       1       3       66        1      active sync   /dev/hdb2
</pre>

and it doesn't show any problems.  What does this mean?  Well, I'm not exactly sure, but it does mean that the disk `/dev/hda` which holds the failed partition (`hda1`) of `md0` isn't completely bad; it's still spinning away and working.  That probably means that the filesystem on `hda1` somehow got muddled up or that there's a physical error on the portion of the disk support `hda1`.  Either way, the first step for me is to simly rebuild the array as it was before.  This is as simple as removing the faulty partition and adding it back to the array:

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm /dev/md0 -r /dev/hda1
mdadm: hot removed /dev/hda1
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hda1
mdadm: hot added /dev/hda1
</pre>

The RAID device will automatically begin rebuilding this partition and keep you informed of the status.

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm --detail /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
        Version : 00.90.03

           UUID : 16c480c4:6bbc2b89:189b2529:3af755b2

       2       3        1        0      spare rebuilding   /dev/hda1
</pre>

Though a failed RAID device isn't the best way to start your morning, managing them in Linux is a fairly straightforward operation.  If the device actually had been bad, I would simply have to shut down the machine, replace the bad drive, partition it like the other one (`fdisk -l` helps) and then add it to the array as shown above.  In most cases, this wouldn't be much harder than what I had to do, though my case the server is a few hundred miles away, so that'd be quite a hike.

If you have forgotten, were never given or otherwise don't have the password to an Oracle database, never fear, there is a method to accessing the database.  From the local machine you must be a user in the group "ora_dba".  Run "sqlplus" (the command line version) with the option "/nolog", which tells SQL*Plus not to login.  At the "SQL>" prompt, type "connect / as sysdba" which ought to log you in.  At that point, you can change the password for any account (`sys` would be a good one to change, since apparently you don't know it) using the command `alter user <username> identified by "<password>";`.  Make sure to `commit;` after doing that.

<p>So, if you have admin access to a windows box, or if you've been delegated authority to manage users, you've successfully owned the oracle databases running on it?</p>

<p>What is sad is that this is a purposefully implemented <em>feature,</em> not a bug to be fixed.</p>

If you know the slightest bit about weather and the geography of the area which you are observing, you can, in the short term, forecast more accurately than what a weather website provides.  I often want to be able to bring a radar image up quickly and clicking around websites takes time.  Sure I could bookmark the weather page directly, but this was an interesting exercise and will prove useful when I get an iPhone.

The [National Weather Service](http://nws.noaa.gov) doesn't have a simple image of the weather on their [radar page](http://radar.weather.gov/radar.php?rid=lwx&product=N0R&overlay=11101111&loop=no), rather, it is an image that is dynamically generated from a set of standard overlays using Javascript.  This allows them to more efficiently distribute radar images, since the terrain and maps that are the background never change.  The organization they use is [well documented](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/doppler/ridge_download.htm), making it easy to find the overlays for you local radar.  In my case, I wanted the topographical map, counties and highways in the image.    I found the URL for each of these components using the aforementioned documentation and grabbed the appropriate images with `wget`.
<pre>
wget http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Legend/N0R/LWX_N0R_Legend_0.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/County/Short/LWX_County_Short.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/Highways/Short/LWX_Highways_Short.gif\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Overlays/Topo/Short/LWX_Topo_Short.jpg\
http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/RadarImg/N0R/LWX_N0R_0.gif
</pre>

The only layer that will change will be the last one, the actual radar data, so in my script that is the only one that will be `wget`d on subsequent runs.  To build the image, I used the `composite` program that is part of the ImageMagick package:
<pre>
composite -compose atop LWX_N0R_0.gif LWX_Topo_Short.jpg base_reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX_Highways_Short.gif base_reflectivity.jpg base_reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX_County_Short.gif base_reflectivity.jpg base_reflectivity.jpg
composite -compose atop LWX_N0R_Legend_0.gif base_reflectivity.jpg base_reflectivity.jpg
</pre>

I want the counties, highways and legend to show up on top of the weather data which itself is pasted atop the topographical map.  To achieve this, I first toss the radar data onto the topographical image creating a new image, `base_reflectivity.jpg`.  Then, I add each of the other layers to the `base_reflectivity.jpg` image in sequence.

BODY:
Python provides a stateful web browsing module called [`mechanize`](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/), named after Perl's mature and featureful [`WWW::Mechanize`](http://search.cpan.org/author/PETDANCE/WWW-Mechanize-1.34/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm).  Though it isn't as powerful as the Perl version, `mechanize` provides an easy-to-use framework for browsing web pages including interacting with forms and accessing SSL content.  The documentation for `mechanize` on the web is sparse, but viewing the source file (`/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mechanize/_mechanize.py` on my Ubuntu machine) provides some needed insight.  Here's a quick overview of the operation of `mechanize`:

<pre class="brush: python;">
#!/usr/bin/python
import re
from mechanize import Browser
br = Browser()

# Ignore robots.txt
br.set_handle_robots( False )
# Google demands a user-agent that isn't a robot
br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Firefox')]

# Retrieve the Google home page, saving the response
br.open( "http://google.com" )

# Select the search box and search for 'foo'
br.select_form( 'f' )
br.form[ 'q' ] = 'foo'

# Get the search results
br.submit()

# Find the link to foofighters.com; why did we run a search?
resp = None
for link in br.links():
    siteMatch = re.compile( 'www.foofighters.com' ).search( link.url )
    if siteMatch:
        resp = br.follow_link( link )
        break

# Print the site
content = resp.get_data()
print content
</pre>

That's a pretty straightforward and simple usage.  The `get_data()` method gives you the HTML content of the pages, which I often find suitable to run a `.split('\n')` and then do some regex on line by line.

<p>I took a different approach to web requests, although your goal was slightly different than mine. To fetch a page, I used a urllib opener. This was necessary for me because google was returning a 403 for my automated search requests without a spoofed user agent, and urrlib supports changing header information.</p>

<p>Cool demonstration - I like your method better, it wins for simplicity.</p>

<p>Just wondering what you meant by "not as powerful as the perl version" I've been looking around and can't find what features are missing. Do you know?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!

<p>For one thing, documentation; that's probably the biggest failing on Python's web browsing module; it may very well do all of the same things as Perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~petdance/WWW-Mechanize-1.34/lib/WWW/Mechanize.pm" rel="nofollow">WWW::Mechanize</a>, but finding out what is possible requires reading the source.  I haven't used Python in the intervening months since writing this post, so I don't even recall what I might have missed when using Python mechanize.</p>

There are no proper Documentations available for most of the python modules, so in the end you need dive in codes unless you have good blogs explaining the same as this one.
Nicely Explained. Short and to the point.

BODY:
Sure, it's already slathered across every news site known to man but just like everyone else I have different reasons for being excited about Perl 5.10.0.

Like many others, I often choose Perl for its seamless regex support so the faster regex engine in this new release is definitely welcome.  This version also fixes an erroneous piece of missing syntax for subscript slices. I was always confused why the interpreter forced me to use `->` instead of the non-arrowed form.  The big one, not because it was hugely lacking but simply a seemingly odd oversight, is the switch statement, which is called `given/when` in Perl:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
given ($foo) {
    when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; }
    when (/^def/) { $def = 1; }
    when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; }
    default { $nothing = 1; }
}
</pre>

Sure, switch statements don't really do anything special, but they are often quite a bit cleaner than if/elif chains and the fact that Perl's implementation can handle regex is awesome.

BODY:
[A new puzzle](http://codegolf.com/grid-computing) went up on [Code Golf](http://codegolf.com) a few weeks ago and I finally got some time to sit down and hack on it, so here's another annotated instalment of my pruning process.  I haven't gotten anywhere near the smallest solutions which are half of my 109 characters.  See the action below, but don't look if you don't want hints!
-----
EXTENDED BODY:


Initially, a straightforward `for` loop that reads from standard input or a passed file; huzzah for Perl's built-in flexibility.  Within this loop, a counter, `$n`, is incremented to fill an array, `@c`, with the sum of each column; the sum of the row is stored in `$r`.  At the end of each iteration of the loop, the greatest row sum, `$a`, is set to the just-completed row if said row is greater than what has been seen previously or the answer is `undef`, as it is the first time through.  The lower loop puts the greatest column sum into `$b`.

My first pass through is 190 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for (<>) {
	$n = $r = 0;
	for (split ' ', $_) {
		@c[$n] += $_;
		$r += $_;
		$n++;
	}

	$a = $r if ($r > $a);
}

for (@c) {
	$b = $_ if ($_ > $b);
}

($b > $a) ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre>

Note that Perl is flexible; by using `<>`, input can be passed as a file on the command line or via stdin.  With some quick re-ordering of the top loop and turning the lower loop into a `map`, 20 characters are saved.  170 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for (<>) {
	$n = $r = 0;
	@c[$n++] += $_, $r += $_ for (split ' ', $_);

	$a = $r if ($r > $a);
}

map {$b = $_ if ($_ > $b)} @c;

($b > $a) ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre>

Much of the whitespace can be removed (though I'll leave the newlines for now).  Down to 138 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for(<>){
	$n=$r=0;
	@c[$n++]+=$_, $r+=$_ for split' ',$_;
	$a=$r if $r>$a;
}

map{$b=$_ if $_>$b} @c;

$b>$a ? print $b.$/ : print $a.$/;
</pre>

The `print` can be simplified, dropping 6 characters:
<pre class="brush: perl;">
for(<>){
	$n=$r=0;
	@c[$n++]+=$_, $r+=$_ for split' ',$_;
	$a=$r if $r>$a;
}

map{$b=$_ if $_>$b} @c;

print $b>$a ? $b.$/ : $a.$/;
</pre>

At which point I'm stuck.  After beating out the last bits of whitespace, that is 109 characters.

BODY:
[The Off The Hook site](http://www.2600.com/oth/) takes a while to post synopsis of the episodes and once they are posted, the overviews aren't very detailed.  I'm going to start taking some notes as I listen to the show and putting them here, for the good of all internet denizens who may find this via Google.

Emmanuel noted that the theme was missing, so he was playing it from a recording of the show that he downloaded last week.  Mitch Altman, who was returning from the [Chaos Communication Congress](http://www.ccc.de) and is the creator of the [TV-B-Gone](http://www.tvbgone.com), was on again; he and Emmanuel discussed [Gizmodo's use of the device at CES](http://gizmodo.com/343348/confessions-the-meanest-thing-gizmodo-did-at-ces).

Emmanuel noted a new program in California that will allow utilities to control home thermostats via radio signals as a method for reducing peak energy usage so as to mitigate rolling blackouts.  Not Kevin wonders how long it will take until someone finds a way to control the temperature of their neighbor's house.

A kid in [Lodz, Poland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA) created a [remote control to control the trams](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/tram_hack/) in the town.  Not Kevin and Mitch discuss whether the remote that the kid created was really like a TV remote employing infrared as was reported.  Emmanuel compares it to a [chrome box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Infrared_Transmitter) and Bernie points out that infrared isn't a very robust method, susceptible to weather conditions that could hamper its operation.

Wisconsin contracted out a mailing to [EDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Data_Systems) who printed [social security numbers on the outside of envelopes](http://consumerist.com/345585/social-security-numbers-visible-on-envelopes-mailed-by-wisconsin-again).  Bernie notes that the government officials always preach their concern for citizen's privacy and guesses correctly that all those affected will receive a free year of credit monitoring, only to be automatically enrolled in such a service for a significant charge at the end of said year.

The [TSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration) took down a horribly insecure website intended to allow people to remove themselves from the no-fly list.  The contract for the site was awarded to [Desyne Web Services](http://desyne.com) by a TSA employee who previously worked for the firm.

[Boeing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)'s new [787](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787) aircraft, which will have internet access available, is going to be thoroughly check to ensure that the internet link is in no way connected to the plane's avionics.  Bernie mentions Boeing's ill-fated [Connexion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connexion_by_Boeing) service.

Bernie talks about a new hacker space, [The Hacktory](http://www.thehacktory.org), which he is helping to put together as an extension of the [Philadelphia Make group](http://makephilly.org).  Mitch talks about visiting [Bootlab](http://bootlab.org) in Berlin, [TMP LABS](http://www.tmplabs.com) in Paris and [c-base](http://c-base.org) as well as [DC401](http://dc401.org) in Providence and [NoiseBridge](https://www.noisebridge.net).  Emmanuel brings up past hacker spaces [L0pht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht) and New Hack City that eventually failed and questions whether these new ones will last.

<p>The depth you went into is impressive. Thanks for all the links!</p>

<p>I remember listening to a talk on hacker spaces from HOPE. They are an incredibly awesome idea, but they have to be hard to sustain. No profit comes from the spaces, and accommodating more people than the initial group just makes things complex in terms of maintenance and responsibilities. </p>

<p>And I wonder if people have considered the security of the wireless networks on 787's aside of being able to control avionics, like if the network is using encryption or not. I can imagine individuals entertaining themselves by sniffing everyone's traffic and hacking laptops for six hours :)</p>

<p>Keep up this line of posting!</p>

<p>Yeah, funding for something like a hacker space is probably a reason for the demise of many prior ones.  I imagine a model where members have to pay dues would be the best implementation.</p>

<p>They didn't go into much detail on the 787, but I can only assume that the electronics controlling the aircraft and associated navigational instruments are entirely separate from those for the passenger side.  At least, I see no reason for them to be connected.</p>

<p>Let's just say ... he forgot to log out one day, and, the people there found some rather 'unsettling' message threads on there on his behalf, yup: 'Michael Jackson style' is the keyword we're looking for here ...</p>

<p>Never wondered why he hangs with all these kids all the time?</p>

BODY:
While writing some Python code today I came to a point where a [switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement) might have been appropriate.  Knowing that switch statements, like any control structure, differ amongst languages I ran a quick search and came up with this  [Python Enhancement Proposal](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/).  The first paragraph of that page is a rejection notice which states, quite simply, "A quick poll during my keynote presentation at PyCon 2007 shows this proposal has no popular support. I therefore reject it."  Wow, that's quite a unilateral decision; I looked at the author, '''guido at python.org''' and thought, "that's certainly his prerogative," for, if you recall analogies from the SAT, Guido van Rossum : Python :: Linus Torvalds : the Linux kernel.

As I pondered Python's lack of this control statement I began to think, well, this probably is the best way for something like Python to be run.  Python is a language that has many passionate follows, many of whom would jump at the chance to make their mark by extending the language.  If the development model allowed anyone to add to it without due process, the language would quickly become cluttered and useless.  No project would ever be run this way, but there are many that employ a loose committee to make such decisions.  Even in that case, however, the committee would certainly waste much time hemming and hawing over the best way to implement the switch and other minutia.  Having a single person in charge makes such project control simple.  Guido, who we can assume is an experience programmer with a good handle on the craft, hence the fact that he created Python and is affectionately known as the [Benevolent Dictator for Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life).  He simply explored the possible options, asked around to see whether this really was a lacking feature of Python and then decided.  End of story.

BODY:
[Here-documents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) are something that, once you know about them, you wonder how you ever got along without.  I first learned about here-docs in Python many years ago, but didn't know their proper name.  In Python, you define a here document with three single or double quotes:

<pre class="brush: python;">foo = """
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu 
fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt 
mollit anim id est laborum.
"""</pre>

One day, when I wanted to put some large blocks of text amongst code, I searched for a way to do this in Perl and found the syntax:
<pre class="brush: perl;">my $foo =<< "EOF";
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et 
dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu 
fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt 
mollit anim id est laborum.
EOF</pre>
Note the use of quotes for the string-terminating sentinel (EOF, in this case, though it can be anything), which affects how the sting is interpreted.  Just like with other strings in Perl, double-quotes mean that variables and escapes will be interpreted whereas they are ignored in single-quoted strings.

BODY:
Anyone who pays attention to the car world from an efficiency perspective has no doubt heard of the popularity that diesel engines have in Europe, but lack in the United States.  Diesels post significantly better distance per volume of fuel (miles per gallon, [furlongs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong) per [peck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peck)) than their gasoline counterparts.  I've always wondered how much of this disparity can be accounted for by diesel fuel's higher energy content.  A quick search turned up [some statistics](http://cta.ornl.gov/data/appendix_b.shtml) (See table B-4) produced by [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory)'s [Center for Transportation Analysis](http://cta.ornl.gov/cta/) which lists a gallon of diesel as containing 38.6 [MJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule) per liter and gasoline as posesing 34.8 MJ/L.  Not that big of a difference; gasoline has 90% the energy content of diesel.

How is this reflected in the mileage of a real car?  Well, let's look at a Volkswagen Jetta which, until recently in the US, could be had with a 1.8 liter gasoline engine or a 1.9 liter diesel.  The gas engine gives 19 MPG city, 27 MPG highway for an EPA combined cycle of 22 MPG ([VW Jetta 1.8L gas](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/20810.shtml)).  The diesel gets 28 MPG city, 39 MPG highway and 32 MPG combined ([VW Jetta 1.9L diesel](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/20812.shtml)).  Working from the combined numbers, the diesel powerplant achieves 45% better mileage with fuel that contains just over 11% more energy content.  Not a bad deal at all.

The next question is how this all works out for the environment.  Historically, diesels have produced much more environmentally destructive exhaust containing more [NOx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxide) and particulates.  Recently, however, diesel fuel in the United States has been switched to an [ultra-low sulfur variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_sulfur_diesel) which, in turn, allows for particulate emission control technologies to be employed, reducing the airborne matter released by diesel engines.  Do the changes mean significantly cleaner emissions?  I'm not sure, because the stats are difficult to find.  Perhaps I'll find them later.

This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [23 April 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0408.html).  The show runs live on [WBAI](http://www.wbai.org) at 7pm on Wednesdays.  Call in at 212.209.2900 or send letters to [oth@2600.com](mailto:oth@2600.com).  The show is also available as a [high-quality podcast](http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/2509).

In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Redhackt, Not Kevin, Lexicon, Mojo from California, Al & Zach from North Carolina<br />
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia

There wasn't a show last week because the show was pre-empted and there isn't one next week; WBAI is having a Report to the Listener show during OTH's time slot so listen in to hear about running a radio station.

Bernie S relates a [Supreme Court decision](http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/court-rules-on-police-search/) concerning a man who was [stopped for a traffic violation](http://www.scotuswiki.com/index.php?title=Virginia_v._Moore), arrested and, as part of the arrest, searched.  The crux of the issue is that the reason for which the man was stopped was not an arrest able offense, thereby making such detainment illegal.  As such, the state appeals court ruled that the pursuant search was also illegal a stance which was overturned by the United States Supreme Court, making the evidence collected during such a search admissible in court.  In the case of <em>Virginia v. Moore</em>, the inventory search performed after the illegal arrest found illegal drugs and the evidence was used to charge Moore with crimes pursuant to those findings.

Another case concerning searches performed by border patrol for people entering the United States.  The ruling made by the [Ninth Circuit court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit) states that border patrol agents [need no suspicion](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=mobile_and_wireless&articleId=9079738&taxonomyId=15&intsrc=kc_top) to search persons entering the country at a border control station.  Though the authority to search sans-probable cause has always been in place for border agents, the question of whether search laptops was also legal had been in question.  Though it is still legal to encrypt data and refuse to divulge the encryption key, the concern of law enforcement officers simply seizing the device as evidence and delaying its return for months or years is brought up.

Bernie S brought up a very interesting combination of the above mentioned decisions wherein a law enforcement officer can illegally arrest you, such as in <em>Virginia v. Moore</em>, they may then search you and subsequently charge crimes based upon what the search finds.

The Australian government is exploring the introduction of laws allowing employers to read all of their employee's company email in order to prevent cyber terrorism.  In the United States, this is already the case since the owner of the network and computers, the employer, is the de-facto owner of all data upon them.

A council in England has employed laws meant to fight terrorism to put families under surveillance in order to ferret out fraudulent school placement applications.

As reported by [Jane's Police Review](http://www.policereview.com/public/jpr/index.html), London's metropolitan police department is [planning to equip all of their officers](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=558597&in_page_id=1770) with microchips that will track their presence.

Israel says that Facebook is a threat to national security because soldiers and government employees post pictures of potentially classified material and equipment.  Redhackt commiserates the desire to post pictures of oneself with interesting military hardware.

This weeks data loss comes from a New York Presbyterrian hospital that lost 40,000 records of patient names and social security numbers.  Unsurprisingly, a spokeswoman fr the hospital says that there is nothing to show that the information has been misused.

Lexicon talks of the Not Our Concern Network Operations Center that will be in place at [The Last Hope](http://www.thelasthope.org/) which he summarizes as a coat check for servers.  Just reserve a spot and you can hook your box up to a [big tube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE) for the duration of the con.  The con will also host a [radio station](http://wiki.hope.net/index.php/HOPE_RADIO) for its entire duration.  Named [Radio Statler](http://radio.hope.net/) after the previous name of the hotel, the radio station is seeking people to help run it during the con weekend.  If you want to help out with the con, or know about it, check out [HOPE.net](http://hope.net).

I don't recall how I came across the free [Proggy font family](http://www.proggyfonts.com/) but I wanted to try them out on my Ubuntu workstation for use in Eclipse.  After some searching, I figured out how to install TrueType (.ttf) fonts and the process is pretty straightforward.  I downloaded and unpacked the fonts into `~/.fonts`, created a fonts.dir metadata file, added them to the font cache and when I restarted Eclipse, they were available.

<pre class="brush: bash;">
~$ mkdir .fonts
~$ cd .fonts
~/.fonts$ wget http://www.proggyfonts.com/download/download_bridge.php?get=ProggyCl
ean.ttf.zip
~/.fonts$ wget http://www.proggyfonts.com/download/download_bridge.php?get=ProggySq
uare.ttf.zip
~/.fonts$ wget http://www.proggyfonts.com/download/download_bridge.php?get=ProggyS
mall.ttf.zip
~/.fonts$ ttmkfdir -o fonts.dir
~/.fonts$ fc-cache -f -v

BODY:
I've heard of doing this for a long time, but always figured it'd be a huge jump to put my home directory into a revision control system.  For years I've scp'd files to a new machine when I moved in and when I made changes to my vimrc or ssh config, it was hell to propagate the changes to my other machines.  No more is this an issue, since I've commited my home directory.  The process is really quite trivial.

I first created a subversion repository on my Linux server.  A special machine isn't required, nor is root access; you just need somewhere that can be accessed with SSH from the intertubes.

<pre>
~$ svnadmin create subversion
</pre>

It's as easy as that.  To begin with, let's create the standard subversion directory structure.

<pre>
~$ svn co file://$home/subversion/ foo
~/foo$ cd foo
~/foo$ mkdir homedir
~/foo$ svn add homedir
~/foo$ svn commit
~/foo$ cd ..
~$ rm -rf foo
</pre>

So now we have a repository with a homedir directory in the root; this is where all of the files from your home directory will be checked into the repository.  To begin with, check out this new project into the root of your home directory.

<pre>
~$ svn co file://$home/subversion/homedir .
</pre>

Since there isn't anything in there, nothing will actually be checked out, but subversion will setup source control on `.`, your home directory.  So let's add something to it.  I have a `.vimrc` that ought to be identical across environments, so I'll check that and my `.vim` support directory into the repository

<pre>
~$ svn add .vim*
A         .vimrc
A         .vim/colors/drew.vim
A         .vim/plugin/feraltogglecommentify.vim
~$ svn commit -m "adding stuff for the first time!"
</pre>

Easy as that, all of my vim configuration files are in subversion.  Now for the awesome part.  Like I mentioned, I have a number of machines and, things like vim configuration files should be the same on all systems.  So now, I hop onto another machine and checkout the homedir project.  First I remove the existing `.vim*` files since they will be replaced with the repository versions.

<pre>
Caligula:~$ rm -rf .vim*
Caligula:~$ svn co svn+ssh://dinomite.net/home/dinomite/subversion/homedir .
A    .vim
A    .vim/colors
A    .vim/colors/drew.vim
A    .vim/plugin
A    .vim/plugin/feraltogglecommentify.vim
Updated to revision 1.
</pre>

Bam.  I've now got the exact same files on both machines.  If I'm at the office and find some flash vim option that I want to use, I simply add it to my `.vimrc`, check it in with `svn ci .vimrc` and when I `svn up` from the other machines, they'll get the new changes.  In reality, I keep a bunch of stuff in my homedir subversion repository: `.bashrc`, `.screenrc`, `bin` directory and many others.  Subversion helps me keep all of my config files in sync across a number of different machines that I use on a daily basis; if you use more than one system with any frequency, I highly suggest checking in your home directory.

<p>Good post. The only thing I can suggest is that if you have read permissions allowed for your subversion repositories, especially if you've configured apache to allow web access to your repository, you may want to lock things down a bit. Adding read access only for authenticated users just for your home directory might be a good idea, especially if you check in private keys in your .ssh folder. I'm sure you've thought of that already though :)</p>

<p>Good point on making it public.  Though I don't have public access, I'm going to set it up so that I can point the many question I get about my rc files to my svn repository.  I haven't checked in any private keys, since I still think it best to generate those per-host.  As Matt(http://www.asktherelic.com/) suggested, I did put my authorized_keys file into my repo, so that having password-less access to a machine is super easy.</p>

<p>Hi Drew! Thanks for your recommendation to try this; I set one up for myself as well. If you use a DVCS it is even easier to set up. In my case, since I'm gay for bazaar, I just ran "bzr init" in the home directory, and it was ready to add the files and commit. Then it was ready to "bzr push" as a branch to any repository I had!</p>

<p>Since I don't have a server I just "bzr init-repo"'d a folder on my data partition to use as a repository. It doesn't protect me against a hard drive failure but it does make it easy to get into the mix quicker when installing a new version of Ubuntu or likewise, and gives me redundant data with history in the process. Eventually I should get a cheap little server. Something like the $99 <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9634061300.html" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9634061300.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9634061300.html</a></a> with a thumbdrive would be pretty functional I suspect.</p>

BODY:
Put the Mechwarrior 2 CD into your Mac's CD drive; it will show up as two mounted discs, one for the audio and one for the game data.  The disc I have is for Mechwarrior 2 v1.1, so the game data is mounted as `/Volumes/MECH2_V1_1`; if you have a different version, the mount point will be slightly different and subsequent commands should be adjusted to match.  To access the disc in DOSBox, you must mount it.  Start DOSBox and type:
<pre>mount d /Volumes/MECH2_V1_1 -t cdrom -usecd 0</pre>
You will also need a place to act as a fake `C` drive, where the game will be installed.  I created a directory `dosprog` in my home directory and mounted it in DOSBox like so:
<pre>mount c ~/dosprog</pre>
To install the game simply go to the mounted CD and run the setup:
<pre>
d:
INSTALL.EXE
</pre>
Follow the installation program, clicking happy things like "yes", "continue" and "full install".  Choose the top-most audio devices in the list.  Next, download the NOCD crack [from here](http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=4454), unzip it in Mac OS and use the files from the crack to replace those in your `dosprog/mech2` folder.  Now, back in DOSBox, go to the c:\MECH2 directory and play:
<pre>
c:
cd c:\MECH2
MECH2.EXE
</pre>

I'm doing some development involving Apache handlers which involves lots of restarting it and occasionally Apache shutting down uncleanly.  After numerous restarts, the webserver refused to start printing the following in the error log:

<pre>
[Wed Jun 25 18:57:11 2008] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: Couldn't create accept lock
</pre>

After being confused because there certainly is enough disk space, I Googled for other possibilities and it turns out I had hit another limit, that of active semaphores.  When some of my processes were killed, they died uncleanly and didn't clean up their open semaphores, filling the maximum number available to my user.  It's easy to tell that this is the root of the issue; running `ipcs -s` showed a list of 95 open semaphores.  Clearing them up is just as easy:

<pre>
~$ for id in \`ipcs -s |awk '/USERNAME/ {print $2}'\`; do ipcrm -s $id; done
</pre>

That prints the list of semaphores, grabs the ID ({print $2}) for lines containing USERNAME (your own or that which the webserver runs under) and then `ipcrm`'s those semaphores.

BODY:
Side by side diffs are much more legible and useful than those in [unified format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format) or any other linear diff.  By default, the `svn diff` command presents output in the unified format, though it has an option, `--diff-cmd`, which allows you to specify the program that will perform the diff.  Passing `vimdiff` as the diff command doesn't work as the options passed by `svn diff` are a bit complicated:

<pre>
~/code/perllib/MG$ cat foo.sh
\#!/bin/bash
echo $*
~/code/perllib/MG$ svn diff --diff-cmd foo.sh Proxy.pm
Index: Proxy.pm
-u -L Proxy.pm (revision 21095) -L Proxy.pm (working copy) .svn/text-base/Proxy.pm.svn-base /tmp/svndiff.tmp
</pre>

Subversion is telling diff to output context (`-u`), show pretty names for the files (`-L`) and then the two files to diff.  To make this work with `vim`, we simply need to cut out the extra options.  To do so, I wrote a simple script:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
\#!/bin/bash
shift 5
vimdiff "$@"
</pre>

I put that in `~/bin/svnvimdiff` and now I can do `svn diff --diff-cmd ~/bin/svnvimdiff Proxy.pm` and view the diff in `vimdiff`.  Since this is a command I use often, I aliased it in my `.bashrc`:
<pre class="brush: bash;">
alias svndiffvim='svn diff --diff-cmd ~/bin/svnvimdiff'
</pre>

Much of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org)'s talk at DEFCON 16 concerned the temporary injunction that prevented [MIT students](http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Anderson) from giving a talk on vulnerabilities of the [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com) farecard system.  The injunction seems to say taht the only people prevented from disseminating the information about the system are the MIT students themselves and any cohorts in their research.  One question that I head was which other systems may be vulnerable to the same RFID card attack and here's the list from their slides:

- Boston
- London
- Netherlands
- Minneapolis
- South Korea
- Hong Kong
- Beijing
- Madrid
- Rio de Janeiro
- New Dehli
- Bangkok

[A blog post](http://billionsconnected.com/blog/2008/08/global-im-market-share-im-usage/) by one of [EQO](http://www.eqo.com)'s founders, Jeff LaPorte, claims to have insight into the market share of the instant messaging services throughout the world.  The [graphic](http://billionsconnected.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/global_im_market_share_stats_july_08.pdf) (PDF) shows the strength of competing IM services in different markets throughout the world.  I immediately questioned the data because it showed AOL Instant Messenger with a narrow lead over MSN and Yahoo!, who share a close second.  Personally, I've never used either of those services, nor do I know anyone who regularly does; is that because I'm a curmudgeon or the EQO data is inaccurate?  I must side with the latter.

The crux of the issue is that EQO is an instant messaging application for mobile phones running Windows CE, so the data they have is for that subset of the IM user market, not representative of the market as a whole.  So what can we glean from this data?  People who have Windows-based smartphones prefer MSN worldwide, save for AIM's slight edge in the United States.  What can't we learn from the data?  The state of the instant message market as a whole.  EQO's usage data ignores other smartphone users, most notably the iPhone and users who don't have smartphones or aren't interested in IMing from their phones.

<pre>
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
</pre>

The machines I was SSHing to don't do GSSAPI, so every time I tried to connect my client had to wait a short timeout before trying other authentication methods.  Since I don't care about GSSAPI (few people use it), I simply set those options to `no` and now my SSH sessions start much more quickly.

I gave this post a vague title because the control of [federal lands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands), such as National Parks, National Memorials and National Forests, is a surprisingly complicated issue.  Tracts controlled by the federal government arise from disparate processes and are controlled by a number of different agencies including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service.

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/zsafwan/2238940368/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2199/2238940368_6ed860e04d.jpg" alt="Map" width="329" height="500" border="0" class="mt-image-right" style="text-align: right; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;"  /></a>

# Agencies
## National Park Service
The most well-known federal land management agency is the [National Park Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service), housed under the [Department of the Interior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior).  The NPS was created in 1916 to organize management of the fledgling system of parks that began with the designation of [Yellowstone National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park) in 1862.

## Bureau of Land Management
Originally created in 1812 as the [General Land Office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Land_Office) under the [Department of the Treasury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Treasury) the [Bureau of Land Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burearu_of_Land_Management) became part of the Department of the Interior after merging with the [United States Grazing Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Grazing_Service).  Unlike the National Park Service, the BLM does not exist as an agency purely to protect the lands that it controls; the BLM issues permits for grazing, logging and mineral collection on many of the lands that they control.

## U.S. Forest Service
The [United States Forest Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service) is responsible for the management of National Grasslands and National Forests, controlling access to grazing, logging and mineral collection on lands under their control in addition to allowing recreation on these lands.

## U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
The [United States Fish and Wildlife Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service) is the caretaker of the country's National Wildlife Refuges and National Fish Hatcheries.

# Lands
## National Park
Beginning with the creation of [Yellowstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone) in 1862 by congress [National Parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park) are areas created by the legislative branch as natural preserves for recreational use by citizens of the country.  National Parks do not allow for logging, mineral extraction or any other exploitation of the land.  These lands are generally the most visited areas controlled by the federal government, receive the most funding for improvements to support visitors to the park and the most legislative attention.  National Parks are all manage under the National Park Service.

## National Monument
As a DC native, the term [National Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._National_Monument) evokes thoughts of man made symbol commemorating a person or event.  In terms of U.S. public lands, however, a national monument is a tract set aside by executive order without the approval of Congress.  The land for a national monument may be that which the federal government already controls or something that is given to the government by an individual or state.  The presidential power to create such lands was granted by the [Antiquities Act of 1906](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_Act) signed by Theodore Roosevelt and first used to protect [Devil's Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Tower_National_Monument) in Northeastern Wyoming.  The intent of the act is to allow the president to afford protection to natural resources of the United States more quickly than an act of Congress is capable.  National monuments are intended to be less expansive than national parks, generally protecting a single natural feature.  Management of national monuments falls to either the National Park Service or the Bureau of Land Management.

## National Memorial
Now this is what should make me think of the [Lincoln](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Memorial) and [Jefferson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Memorial) Memorials in Washington.  [National Memorials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Memorial) are protected areas established by the legislative branch to commemorate a historic person or event.  Though most National Memorials are administered by the National Park Service, some, such as the [Benjamin Franklin National Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_National_Memorial) are overseen by another organization and considered an affiliated area of the NPS.

## National Wilderness Area
A [National Wilderness Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wilderness_Preservation_System)  is defined within land that is already under federal control by the [Wilderness Act of 1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness_Act) as an area in which commercial activities are forbidden and human activity is limited to non-motorized recreation and non-invasive activities such as scientific study.  NWAs exist under the cooperative purview of all four land management agencies, the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.

## National Forest and Grassland
Managed by the [Forest Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service), a division of the [Department of Agriculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture), [National Forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest) are unlike their protected brethren in that commercial exploitation of their resources is allowed with permits given for grazing, logging and mineral extraction.  Lands administered by the Forest Service my also be licensed for commercial recreation such as ski resorts.  National Forests are created by executive order as granted by the [Land Revision Act of 1891](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Revision_Act_of_1891) and [National Grasslands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Grassland) by the [Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act](http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode07/usc_sec_07_00001000----000-.html).

## National Recreation Area
Until 1963, [National Recreation Areas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recreation_Area) were created by executive order but a change in policy means that all Areas designated thereafter are by legislative action.  National Recreation Areas can be managed by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service.  NRAs are usually created to encourage water sports on lakes created by the damming of rivers.

## National Wildlife Refuge
Originally defined by the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 a National Wildlife Refuges exist, unsurprisingly, as habitats for specific or groups of species.  They are created by congressional legislation and administrated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

## National Seashore
Usually controlled by the National Park Service, [National Seashores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_seashore) are protected areas that are similar to both NRA's and National Parks.  Most of the areas contained within a National Seashore is available for recreation, often including vehicular offroading trails.

## National Historical Park
[National Historical Parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historical_Park) or National Historic Sites are historically significant structures or areas governed by the National Park Service.  These areas were at one time declared by the Secretary of the Interior, but in modern times by acts of congress.

## Parkway
Parkways are roads controlled by the National Park Service and are often scenic roads through federally controlled lands, such as [Blue Ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway) and [Rock Creek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Creek_and_Potomac_Parkway) parkways.  Others, such as a significant portion of the [Baltimore-Washington Parkway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Parkway), are not maintained by the NPS but state and local agencies instead.

BODY:
Having a purgatory for files that are on their way to deletion, such as the trash can in Mac OS or the recycle bin in Windows, is a great idea, for even the most careful users occasionally delete something only to find that they later need it.  Unfortunately, the two aforementioned implementations, as well as those in Gnome and KDE, only allow you to empty the trash all at once.  Much more useful is to have a timeout where files that are sent to the trash are automatically removed after a period of time.  I finally got around to implementing this myself in Mac OS by putting the following in my [crontab](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/14/terminal_one.html):

<pre>
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/find /Users/<username>/.Trash -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -mtime +14 -exec rm -rf {} \;
</pre>

Every day at 0500 any item more than 14 days old is delete from the trash can.  To install it, read the linked article above or, if you know the command line, open a terminal, type `crontab -e`, paste the above (substituting your username) and save the file.

<strong>Edit:</strong> In the comments, Matt mentioned [Compost](http://www.fastforwardsw.com/compost/), a preference pane for OS X that provides the functionality I describe, but also the ability to limit the trash based upon size, and also manage the Trash on other volumes.  Neat!  It's $20, but definitely makes this process easier and understandable if you aren't a Unix person.

<p>Just googled exactly this problem, thanks for the command.</p>

<p>But is there any reason why you didn't use -atime instead of -mtime? I mean, access time would be much more useful, wouldn't it?
Modification time is not necessarily the time you moved it to trash right?</p>

<p>As for mtime v. atime, I actually hadn't even thought about using atime but you're right, it's much more appropriate.  Looking through the find(1) man page, ctime (last metadata change time) would work, too.</p>

<p>This page was the first google results and really helped.
Let just me add that you can run it at any time, replacing the first two numbers (0 and 5) with hours and minutes (I'm running it at midday, so my crontab entry starts with 12 0).
Thanks Drew!</p>

<p>If you'd like a little bit prettier and more fully-featured interface, check out Compost, which is a Finder extension that implements automatic trash cleanup like this, but with more options and a GUI.  I have no connection with the author, but I've been using the Compost extension for a while and love it, so I thought you might appreciate the pointer.</p>

Great tip, just what I was looking for. One note tough your cron script will run at 05:00 instead of 00:05. The format for a cron job is "minutes hours ..." not "hours minutes"

I learned something new in the world of Perl regular expressions today when I came across this line:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
 my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = $string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/;
</pre>

The operative side of the line, `$string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/` is a normal Perl regex binding statement - apply the regular expression `/(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/` to `$string`.  What's interesting is that the binding operator returns the things matched within the capturing parenthesis as an array, allowing you to assign them all at once, as demonstrated by the left hand side of that `=` expression.  The above statement does the same as the more verbose:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
$string =~ /(.oo)(.*?r)(.*?z)/;
my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = ($1, $2, $3);
</pre>

Used in a scalar context along with the `/g` modifier, this is an easy way to count count occurences:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
my $count = $string =~ m/\./g;
</pre>

This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [5 March 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0308.html).

In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Not Kevin
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia

Emmanuel credits last weeks record donations to the Lego kits that were given as premiums and promises many Legos at the [HOPE conference](http://www.thelasthope.org/) this year.  Pre-registration for the conference is open.

Mike brings up the case brought against [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org) by [Bank Julius Baer](http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Bank_Julius_Baer) that caused the California-based registrar that registered the domain wikileaks.com, [Dynadot](http://www.dynadot.com/), to de-register the name.  The Swiss bank with ties to the Cayman Islands has since dropped their suit against Wikileaks after the [Streisand Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) brought more press to the issue than it would have gotten had they simply left Wikileaks alone.

Meanwhile, a British man running a [travel agency specializing in trips to Cuba](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/05/us_kills_european_based_cuba_websites/) has had a number of his domain names, [ciaocuba.com](http://www.ciaocuba.com) and [bonjourcuba.com](http://www.bonjourcuba.com) among others, de-registered because they were bought through an American registrar, [eNom](http://enom.com).  The man was recently added to the Treasury department's list of [Specially Designated Nationals](http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/sdnlist.txt) which consists of persons who deal with organizations and countries that the United States finds unsavory.

Emmanuel mentions a new law in New Jersey law which makes talking on cellphones and two-way radios illegal but has an exemption for amateur radio operators.

The German constitutional court has struck down a law allowing investigators to install spyware on suspects' computers.

FBI director [Robert Mueller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller) has announced that a DOJ report will show that FBI investigators abused [national security letters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter) using them to obtain information from banks, telephone and internet providers under circumstances that did not warrant their use.

Pakistan has blocked access to YouTube because the video site posted a blasphemous video.  After being told that routers were probably used to block the site the head of the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority said, "We are not hackers, why would we do such a thing?"

Digital television is coming in 2009.  In order to use non-digital TVs with the new over-the-air digital signal a converter box must be used.  Vouchers for the boxes can be obtained from [dtv2009.gov](https://www.dtv2009.gov/).  The group speculates that the changeover won't go smoothly at all.

One out of 99 American adults is in prison, with a total of 1.6 million prisoners in the company.  The United States leads the world in incarceration rates.

Phone calls - 212.209.2900
Letters - oth@2600.com

A listener who hosts a show on [Radio Free Olympia](http://frolympia.org), a pirate radio station in Washington writes in to praise Off The Hook.

A caller says that he saw NYPD vehicles using what are presumably automatic license plate scanners that resemble spotlights in their vehicles.  He says that they drive slowly through neighborhoods, presumably to scan all the plates of parked cars.  Bernie has an idea to print out the license plates of most wanted criminals and posting them where the police scan in order to slow down such automated scanning.

A caller asks about receiving digital television signals from Jersey.  Despite having a large antenna in his attic, he is unable to receive the digital version of a channel that he receives fine in analog.  Bernie notes that the UHF frequencies for digital TV are higher than those for analog and so the antenna might not be tuned properly.

<p>I'll actually be driving through Olympia tomorrow, I think I'll tune in to the referenced station's frequency and see what they are all about.</p>

<p>I don't get the USA and its policy toward Cuba. I mean, I understand its history and where it originated, but the policies on Cuba are getting pretty dated. I wonder how things will change with Raul in power?</p>

I hope you can catch some of their programming.</p>

<p>I hope that Fidel stepping down will allow congress to re-think (read: get rid of) our Cuba embargo that is totally ineffective and based upon 60's conflicts.</p>

<p>There wasn't any talk of whether or not this will be the last conference, I think the name is more of a reference to the loss of the hotel.  <a href="http://talk.hope.net/viewtopic.php?id=4" rel="nofollow">In his usually melodramatic style</a>, Emmanuel seems to think it will be difficult to continue the conference if the Hotel Pennsylvania really does go away.  I think that a way will be found to continue what is one of the largest conferences in the country, though it may mean an end to the very low admission price.</p>

BODY:
If you try to `rsync` from a Mac OS X machine using the `-E` switch (capture extended attributes & resource forks - you want this) to a Linux or BSD computer, you'll get something like the following error:

<pre>
rsync: on remote machine: -vlogDtprzE: unknown option
rsync error: syntax or usage error (code 1) at main.c(1108)
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at /SourceCache/rsync/rsync-30/rsync/io.c(359)
</pre>

What's the holdup?  Well, [resource forks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork) are a purely Mac OS construct (though NTFS has [Alternative Data Streams](http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1822) that aren't often used) allowing specific data, such as icons and application metadata, to be [shoved into a file](http://vafer.org/blog/20080215024239).  The standard version of `rsync` doesn't support these containers, so Apple includes a patched version in Mac OS X to handle them and in order to get this support on a non-Mac, you must install this patched version.  Doing so is a fairly simple affair, since Apple makes the patch readily available through their [Darwin source site](http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/).

Since I'm running Mac OS 10.5.2 (the latest update to Leopard), the files I need are in the 10.5.2 branch of the `darwinsource` directory; change that number to your version of OS X or navigate from the above mentioned Darwin source site.

<pre>
wget http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.2/rsync-30/rsync-2.6.3.tar.gz \
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.5.2/rsync-30/patches/EA.diff
</pre>

Don't ask me why the directory is `rsync-30` when they're using `rsync-2.6.3`.  Now it's just a simple matter of unpacking the source, applying the patch and compiling `rsync`:

<pre>
tar zxf rsync-2.6.3.tar.gz && cd rsync-2.6.3 && patch < ../EA.diff && \
./configure --enable-ea-support && make && sudo make install
</pre>

By default, it installs to `/usr/local/bin/rsync` so installing this version won't trash that put in place by your sytem's package manager.  I also found a post on [macosxhints.com](http://macosxhints.com) concerning `rsync` interacting with the disk indexing of Spotlight.  If you are writing tons of files to a Spotlight-indexed disk on a Mac, the indexer can become overwhelmed.  The solution is to disable Spotlight on the disk in question with `mdutil -i off <mountpoint>` or to write into a directory appended with `.noindex`.

<p>Too bad this no longer works with the rsync 2.6.9 included in OS 10.5.5; Apple has apparently changed their build system so that extended attributes will only be included if rsync is compiled under OS X.</p>

<p>It might be possible to get the same effect by patching the source with Apple's acl and xattr patches, compiling the source awailable at Apple's site under BOTH OS X and Linux using the --enable-xattr parameter and then using that rsync with the -X switch. But I haven't tried that.</p>

The last week of fundraising.

Emmanuel plays a clip from 30 November 1999 where Amy Goodman was covering the [WTO protests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO_Ministerial_Conference_of_1999_protest_activity) in Seattle, which he cites as the beginning of the independent media movement on the internet.  He relates a story of Shapeshifter, 2600's layout artist, who was arrested in Philadelphia after police saw him talking on a cell phone and accused him of organizing the protests.  Shapeshifter later won a suit against the city for wrongful arrest, since his using a telephone was the limit of their evidence.

BODY:
When you install Mac OS X, it asks you for your full name, which is what it will use for what it calls the username.  Despite calling it the username, it is not actually field 1 in `/etc/passwd`, which is what Unix users would call the username.  Mac OS X refers to the first field of `/etc/passwd` as a user's "short name," normally a concatenated and lowercased version of your full name.  As one would expect, your Unix username, what you would use to login at a console or via SSH, is actually the short name; your files are stored in /Users/<shortname> and are owned by <shortname>.

Like many Unix users, I have a username (dinomite) that is different from my real name (Drew Stephens) and I like it that way.  Having a username on one machine that doesn't match that on all of my others is a hassle, requiring me to specify a username whenever I SSH to or from said machine.  After having reinstalled OS X recently I wanted to change my short name on the system to rectify this problem.  Though some tutorials make it seem like an [involved process](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106824), it's actually fairly straightforward if you have some Unix and OS X experience.  Here's how I did it in 10.5 (Leopard).

First, you must enable the root user; we will make all the username changes while logged in as root.  You could also login as another user and use sudo (hint: `sudo -i`) to do this, but I had no other users on my machine.  To enable root, open Applications > Utilities > Directory Utility, then click the lock in the Directory Utility window and enter your username & password.  Choose "Enable Root User" from the Edit menu and supply a password for root when prompted.

Now that root is enabled, log out of your own account, click "Other..." in the login window and supply root's credentials.  Once logged in, we need to create a the new user with the desired short name.  Open System Preferences and select the Accounts pane.  Add a new user by clicking the '+' at the bottom and fill in the Name & short name fields as desired; I used a temporary name (Drew) and the short name I wanted (dinomite), since you can't have two identically named users and the name can be easily changed later.

Open a terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and change to /Users.  `ls` ought to show directories for both your current short name and the newly created one.  Now you just have to move your files from your old short name to the new one: `mv <old short name>/* <old short name>/.* <new short name>/`.  Once that completes, you need to change the ownership to the new short name: `chown -R <new short name> /Users/<new short name>`.  Since everything is now in the new users' domain, you can now delete your old username, log out of root and log in using your newly short named account.

[Richard Dawkins'](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/113) talk from the 2002 [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com) was recently posted on the web (ok, it was a year ago, but I just saw it) and it's a very good summary of his views militant atheism.  Now, Dawkins isn't advocating violence in support of atheism, unlike that done by [so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Natan-Zada) [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization) [religious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism) [groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_Islam), but rather supporting of [strong atheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_and_strong_atheism) and an end to religion.

<blockquote>In my view, not only is science is corrosive to religion and religion is corrosive to science.  It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations we have within our grasp.  It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence.</blockquote>

<p>I have no problem with personal faith, but I am severely disillusioned with organized religion. This was a good talk, and one I had missed up until now. Thanks for pointing it out :)</p>

<p>&lt;3 TED. Heewa is starting up a discussion group with similar goals, just to have people talk and present things for the simple purpose of exposing people to ideas. The only difference with his bit is that it will be followed with discussion, so it will be a more interactive event - for better or worse.</p>

<p>Also similarly - are you coming up for Barcamp? I'm sure you could give a hell of a presentation on biometrics ;)</p>

<p>If you liked that talk, check out <em>The God Delusion</em> which is very much an expanded version of Dawkins' TED talk.  My biggest thing is maintaining a strong <a href="http://www.ffrf.org" rel="nofollow">separation between church and state</a>, which has been very much eroded during the Bush administration, assisted by people like Bill O'Reilly who insist that there is a War on Christmas.</p>

<p>Sort of on the subject of atheism, I've wanted to create something satirically called the Church of Science (not to be confused with <a href="http://xenu.org" rel="nofollow">Scientology</a> or the nuts from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Christ,_Scientist" rel="nofollow">Church of Christ, Scientist</a>).  Such an organization would provide a weekly social gathering like a church but rather than a sermon, there would be a weekly talk on science, technology or engineering given by a church member or guest.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="http://barcamp.org/" rel="nofollow">Barcamp in Berkely</a> on the 29th, which I might attend since it's near my new home but, as for the Rochester gathering, I don't think so.</p>

[Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) made a very good point recently about [browser shortcuts](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001037.html) that make browsing the web quicker because they reduce your dependence upon the mouse.  If you have any semblance of [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) caused by mouse usage, like mine is, then learning to maximize use of the keyboard in place of the mouse is paramount.  Following on this I will share a number of [smart bookmarks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_bookmark) that I have found to be indispensible since I started using them way back when [Galeon](http://galeon.sourceforge.net/Main) was my browser of choice and Firefox née Phoenix wasn't even on the drawing board.

Smart bookmarks are bookmarks that you call with a keyword and an argument; the argument is shoved into the appropriate place within the bookmark and the resulting URL is then retrieved.  Their function is similar to the manner in which a fresh installation of Firefox will automatically bring up a Google search results page if you type something that isn't a URL into the address bar.  To create a smart bookmark in Firefox, first bookmark a page such as a Google Search results page in the normal fashion.

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google-foo.png' title='Google foo'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google-foo.png' alt='Google foo' /></a>

Then, open the "Organize Bookmarks" window by selecting it from the Bookmarks menu in Firefox.

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bookmarks.png' title='Organize Bookmarks'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bookmarks.png' alt='Organize Bookmarks' /></a>

Select "Properties" for the bookmark you created and enter something into the "Keyword" field; for Google, I use the letter "g".  To actually make it a smart bookmark, you need to tell your browser where the string you pass needs to end up by placing "%s" (a percent sign and an "s") in the appropriate place.  For my Google search bookmark, the resulting URL string is this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnG=Google+Search

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/properties.png' title='Bookmark properties'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/properties.png' alt='Bookmark properties' /></a>

What does this get you?  Well, now you can select the address bar (Apple+L in MacOS, Ctrl+L or Alt+D in Windows & Linux) type "g foo" in order to search for "foo".  A lot of people use the search bar in Firefox to do just that already, but I find my method better because I have a ton of smart bookmarks for performing different searches.  Alongside that one for Google, I have a [Wikipedia smart bookmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s) (bookmark that link and add a keyword such as "w") which will take me directly to the Wikipedia article for the string I enter, a [Wikipedia search bookmark](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%s%20site%3Aen.wikipedia.org&btnG=Google+Search) that does a Google search of just Wikipedia ("ws") and a [Google Finance search bookmark](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=%s) ("gf").

Others that I use include:
<ul>
<li>a - <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-2288794-0413724?url=search-alias%3daps&field-keywords=%s&go.x=0&go.y=0&go=go">Amazon</a></li>
<li>p - <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=%s&searchon=names&subword=1&version=feisty&release=all">Ubuntu package search</a></li>
<li>pc - <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?word=%s&searchmode=searchfiles&case=insensitive&version=feisty&arch=i386">Ubuntu package contents search</a></li>
<li>d - <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=%s&x=0&y=0">Dictionary</a></li>
<li>t - <a href="http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=%s">Thesaurus</a></li>
<li>pd - <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/search.html?q=%s">Perldocs</a></li>
<li>pm - <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=%s&mode=all">CPAN</a></li>
<li>y - <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_query=%s&search=Search">YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

By far the ones that I use the most are those for Google and Wikipedia searching but having ultra-quick access to a thesaurus and dictionary greatly heightens my writing skill.  Smart bookmarks are something where, once you start using them, you'll wonder how others ever get stuff done while they waste time reaching for the mouse.

This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [12 March 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0308.html).  The show runs live on [WBAI](http://www.wbai.org) at 7pm on Wednesdays.  Call in at 212.209.2900 or send letters to [oth@2600.com](mailto:oth@2600.com).  The show is also available as a [high-quality podcast](http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/2509).

In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Not Kevin<br />
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia

[Chinese hackers claim](http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/03/07/china.hackers/) to have gained access to worldwide sites including [the Pentagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon) and are purportedly funded by [that state's government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China).

[A computer security analyst](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/whistleblower-f.html) says that a major telecommunications carrier, perhaps Verizon Wireless, is in cahoots with the [FBI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation) after he was told not to enable any security on a circuit named "Quantico" by supervisors while performing a migration.  Such a lack of security gives the aforementioned circuit unfettered access to the carrier's entire network perhaps even uploading their own firmware to customers handsets.  Not Kevin points out that with GSM phones it is much easier for users to prevent such tampering with their phones, since customers have a choice and can easily change their carrier by changing the SIM card.  Bernie brings up the recent [CALEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act) legislation that allows federal agencies to bypass the step of obtaining a warrant and providing it to the phone companies.  Furthermore, there is no logging of such taps making it impossible to account for wiretapping actions.

If you are suspicious of the number of mobile phones that someone has, notify the [London police at 0800789321](www.met.police.uk/campaigns/docs/postcard.pdf) (PDF link).

[MAKE Magazine](http://www.makezine.com/) has [an article](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/02/temporarily_blind_surveil.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) for a method of blinding surveillance cameras.  It uses infrared LEDs to wash out the image by flooding the camera with infrared light that isn't visible to the naked eye but is picked up by most [CCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device)s.

[Muni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Municipal_Railway) drivers in San Francisco have had trouble with hooligans turning off the buses via an unlocked panel that hides a switch controlling the power for the entire bus.  Those on the show first heard about this vulnerability from Shapeshifter at least 4 years ago.  Bernie notes that the reason for the switches is to allow the power to be cut in an emergency, necessitating easy access to the switch.

A listener writes in about a service, [EarthCaller](http://www.earthcaller.com/index.php) a browser-based VOIP service that works only with Internet Explorer.  The listener brings [magicJack](http://www.magicjacktv.com/1/index.asp) mentioned on the program a while back that allows you to use a normal phone with VOIP via a Windows computer.  According to Not Kevin the [Personal Computer Show](http://wbai.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=358&Itemid=42) hosts have one of the devices and are unimpressed with its quality.

The same listener also advocates the use of the use of [800-call-411](http://www.livesearch411.com/) rather than [GOOG411](http://www.google.com/goog411/) because the former service doesn't mention whether or not they record the call.  Emmanuel first calls GOOG411 attempting to get the number for WBAI but gets some other business on Wall Street that sounds like Dubai.  The other service, 800-call-411 comes up with WBAI immediately without fuss, though it is unable to understand WBAI's telephone number.

"P" writes in asking for Jim's information:
<blockquote>
Caton Park Nursing Home<br />
Attn: Jim Vichench<br />
1312 Caton Avenue, Rm. 312B<br />
Brooklyn, New York 11226<br />
</blockquote>
Emmanuel says that a number of people have visited Jim and it has been well appreciated.

A Massachusetts listener brings up the cell phones for train conductors test that was mentioned on last weeks show applauding the fact that the municipality is at least testing the system.  The listener notes that this is better than a program in his commonwealth that equipped snowplows with GPS enable cell phones that turned out to be a complete failure.

Someone writes in to mention the new Mac OS X "virus" [Newton](http://www.troika.uk.com/virus.htm).  The letter also mentions [Windows XP Black Edition](http://www.computerdefense.org/2007/02/07/windows-xp-black-edition/) and notes that it is very likely filled with malware.

Those in the studio and a listener mention that they haven't received their [vouchers for digital to standard definition converter boxes](https://www.dtv2009.gov/).

An amateur radio operator who also acts as a weather spotter says that hams perform a valuable public service during times of emergency.

A caller asks about HD radio, specifically whether special antennas are needed.  Not Kevin points out that all HD radios contain a decoder created by [iBiquity](http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio) who has a patent on the technology.  He and Bernie both say that HD radio is of no higher quality and doesn't stand for High Definition, unlike new television technologies.

A question about cell phone repeaters comes from a caller and Bernie says that such systems [are available](http://www.repeaterstore.com/), though probably not economical.

<p>Hah, I was just looking at cellphone repeaters. We are building a new house, and the lot has pretty close to zero reception. I'm not sure they are worth it, given the price tag is hovering around $500.</p>

<p>I'm not sold on the claims of the Chinese hackers. I mean, they probably are all up in our shiznit, but it is doubtful anyone performing covert electronic reconnaissance would be bragging about it.</p>

<p>Yeah, my parents have talked about getting a cellphone repeater for their beach house but really, unless you're married to your cellphone company (or your location /really/ doesn't get any service), they don't seem to be worth it.  For most people it makes more sense to try another provider.</p>

<p>You are spot-on about the Chinese hackers.  I have no doubt <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120526061992427783.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="nofollow">Chinese hackers have infiltrated US government systems</a>, but those who are doing so certainly wouldn't be talking about it openly.  These guys are just crackers who have a good virus ring or something of that sort.</p>

After a couple days of seeing next to nothing while driving through southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas, a day of <strong>absolutely</strong> nothing was on tap in the form of West Texas.  Our drive took us from Abilene through [Sweetwater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater,_Texas) to Big Spring where we ditched the interstate in favor of state highways.  Plentiful along this route are oil wells, pumps visible for as far as one can see.  There were also a number of drilling crews working to create new wells in the the most productive oil fields on the continent.  Additionally, Sweetwater is home to the [largest wind generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm) concentration in the Western hemisphere.  The hills in the town are home to innumerable multi-megawatt, 90+ meter diameter wind turbines.  Other than said hills, the highest thing around is a highway overpass, from which I took a few pictures.

After passing through [Hobbs, NM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbs,_New_Mexico), we headed south-southeast toward [Carlsbad, NM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad,_New_Mexico) in order to see the [Carlsbad Cavern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park) near that town.  Though I had been to [Luray Caverns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luray_Caverns) as a kid, I remembered little of that cave.  No matter, as Carlsbad dwarfs its East-coast equivalent.  The size of the cavern, from the incredible entrance and the significant depth to the amazing underground area is astounding.  Most striking is the lighting, apparently designed by a Broadway theater technician.  If you are going through Arizona, Carlsbad Cavern is certainly something to stop and see.  Even outside of the cave, the drive through the canyon in the park and the resulting view from the mesa are worth the trip.

There's a small chain of [taquerías](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquer%C3%ADa) in the [Bay Area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area) called Taquería Pancho Villa.  At the [San Mateo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mateo,_California) location this evening I noticed a plaque commemorating the [revolutionary general](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa).  I took picture of it and [translated](http://google.com/translate) it when I got home:

In tribute to Pancho Villa (Doroteo Arango [Arámbula, his full name])
To 119 years of his birth (San Juan River, Durango)
And 74 years of his death (Parral, Chihuaua)

I wanted to change the mirrors that CPAN was set to use because it seemed that the first one on the list wasn't responding.  I figured there must be a way to do this from the CPAN command line and indeed, a quick Google search [turned up a result](http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/#s5).  To do what I wanted, I first printed the current URL list, shifted off the offending host and then wrote the altered configuration to disk for next time

The fifth day began with visiting [Petroglyph National Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph_National_Monument) just outside of Albuquerque, a city whose name I can now spell without looking it up.  While the [petroglpyhs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph) themselves are interesting, I found the best part of the park was the short hike to the top of one of the mesas to see an awesome view of Albuquerque and the surrounding landscape.  The lava rock fields that constitute the national monument were formed by the [cinder cones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone) that are atop the mesa.  The volcano's discharge covers much of the tops of the mesas and spills over the edge into the folded canyons where the images are carved.

Next up was the [Painted Desert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_Desert%2C_Arizona) and [Petrified Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_Forest_National_Park) in Arizona.  Though the petrified wood is quite striking, I found the painted desert to be more breathtaking.  The majority of the painted desert scenes are North of [Interstate 40](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_40), displaying a vivid array of color stripes across the canyon walls and cones.  I hadn't thought about the fact that the landscape is formed by wind and water erosion, but it's unsurprising that the wind in the entire area is constantly gusting.

After seeing the first park in Arizona, we headed toward Flagstaff and then North to the Grand Canyon.  We booked a room at a hotel just outside of the park and tried to drive in to get dinner at the main lodge but failed because they were completely full, which is probably the case nearly year round at the canyon.  In the few minutes we were walking around the lodge, however, we were within 10 feet of the rim, a fact we didn't realize until the next day upon seeing it in the light the next day.

The fourth day started with a trip to see [White Sands National Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_National_Monument) which is contained within the Army's [White Sands Missile Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range).  That point is important because when we arrived at the park around 8:30AM, we were told that the road in wouldn't open until 9:45 due to a missile test at the surrounding range.  Immediately upon entering the park, you are surrounded by brilliant white sand in the form of dunes covered with desert vegetation.  In short order, the vegetation subsides leaving nearly naked alabaster mounds surrounding the park road.  Even from atop the dunes, the only thing visible is the white sand and the mountains surrounding the [Tularosa Basin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tularosa_Basin).

After seeing White Sands, we drove back through Alamogordo North to Carrizozo, NM, West to [Socorro, NM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socorro,_New_Mexico) and further to the [Very Large Array](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array).  The 25 meter radio telescopes at the VLA are individually huge and the array is something to behold even in the medium configuration that we saw, with only a few hundred meters between them.  What's more striking is to see the enormous size that the telescopes can be arranged as each of the railroad track arms is 25 kilometers long.  Thankfully, the VLA was courteous enough to put this in terms very easy for a Washingtonian to understand.

<a href='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-v-dc.jpg' title='VLA v. DC'><img src='http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/vla-v-dc.jpg' alt='VLA v. DC' /></a>

After seeing all of that, we headed to Albuquerque and had dinner at a standard city brewpub, [Kelly's](http://www.kellysbrewpub.com/) near [the univeristy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico).  Driving through the city was very nice, as the facades throughout town are all very entertaining to see.

<p>Yeah, the telescopes sit on pedestals accessed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_siding" rel="nofollow">sidings</a> next to the main arms of the Y.  They certainly don't <a href="http://www.vla.nrao.edu/genpub/configs/" rel="nofollow">re-arrange the array often</a>, as all 27 dishes have to be moved by 2 machines that move at a fast walking pace.  Setting them up in the largest configuration at the full 13 mile length of the arms could take quite a while.</p>

<p>Something I didn't know is that the data interpretation is done at <a href="http://virginia.edu" rel="nofollow">UVA</a> in Charlottesville, VA.</p>

I'm moving from [The Commonwealth of Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia) to [The California Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley).  As an adventure, and a means to get my car to the West Coast, I'm driving across the country with my dad in my [M3](http://gallery.dinomite.net/v/Cars/BMW_M3/).  Because of the nature of the car, we're avoiding the snowy highways through the middle of the country and following a generally southern route.

The first day took us through southwestern Virginia and into Tennessee, ending at Jackson, TN, about 100 miles from Memphis.  There isn't much to speak of in this are, save the fairly constant expanse of [Appalachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia) that I'm used too.  Lots of [deciduous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous) trees, rolling hills and [blue mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains).

One good part of the day was stopping at a [barbecue shack](http://www.hogheavenbbq.com/) near [Vanderbilt University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University) in Nashville.

The second day started with a trip through Memphis, TN to stop by [Graceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland), not because either of us particularly care about Elvis but it's a major stop for Americana, so you can't just drive by.  Surprisingly, even on Easter this landmark of tackiness was open and visitors could take a tour of the mansion, were they so inclined.  This was of little interest so, after a couple of pictures, we drove on to Arkansas with a stop to see the Mississippi river up close.  The river is incredibly wide as everyone has always heard and it was moving quite quickly due to recent rains.

In Arkansas, the terrain more or less continued getting a bit flatter as we moved on.  Little Rock isn't very big and the sparsely populated terrain continues all the way to Dallas except for the border town of [Texarkana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit).  [Dallas-Fort Worth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas/Fort_Worth_Metroplex) is as huge as one would expect, but we were on our way to [Abilene, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas) which held another pleasant gastronomic surprise.  In Abilene we had dinner at the [Lytle Land and Cattle Co.](http://www.lytlelandandcattle.com/) which served undoubtedly the finest steak I have ever had.  I wouldn't have believed prior to this that a steak could be so good and it's surely due mostly to the quality of the local beef.  Texas is, unsurprisingly, a great place to get a steak and I am now inclined to try [Omaha Steaks](http://www.omahasteaks.com) that you can get by mail.

After years of being cold on the slopes, I think that I've finally gotten the gear to keep myself warm.  Through a high of 4 degrees Fahrenheit a few days ago and 16 degree snow with 20+ MPH winds today.  I'm sure someone will find this information useful.

I wear a helmet, so hats are out of the question.  Instead, I have an [Icebreaker Quantum](http://www.icebreaker.com/site/icebreaker_man_hats_gt220_quantum_balaclava.html) balaclava; in addition to being quite warm, it stays so even when wetted with snow or breath.  As for tops, I wear an [Under Armour ColdGear mock turtleneck](http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/mens/sports/snow-sports/apparel/shop-by-layer/baselayer/pid1000512-Men-s-ColdGear-Longsleeve-Mock/1000512-414) with an [Icebreaker Bodyfit 260 TechTop](http://www.icebreaker.com/site/icebreaker_man_bodyfit260_tech_top.html) over top of that.  I think this combination of a tight-fitting synthetic base layer with very warm merino wool atop is the best way to go.  When the weather is very cold, such as the aforementioned bitter or windy days, I wear a [Descente Podium](http://www.descente.com/product/119595/D9-0716/_/Podium_Vest) vest.  I top this all with a [Spyder Rival](http://www.spyder.com/Mens-Insulated-Jackets/Rival-Jacket-3216.html?color=600) insulated jacket.

My hands have always been a very difficult part, but was the final piece that I solved this year.  I'm wearing a pair of [Manzella Silkwieght Windstopper gloves](http://www.rei.com/product/766531), which are just thin, polyester pieces, inside a set of [Black Diamond Mercury Mitts](http://www.bdel.com/gear/mercury_mitt.php) which are absolutely wonderful.  The mitts are roomy enough that my hands with those liners fit easily, allowing me to quickly pop them out to take pictures, use my phone, or deal with my gear.  Polyester for the liners is good because it shed snow when I do pull my hands out of the mitts.  The my outer handwear also has [insulation that is easily removable](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3126195411/), making overnight drying a snap.

On bottom, I wear a single pair of [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com) socks and a couple of pairs of polyester long underwear.  I should really get some wool long underwear, because it's certainly better than polypropylene.  Generally, though, I'm doing enough with my legs that I don't have that much problem.

Note on brands: I mention all the brands of things I wear because it makes clear exactly what I'm talking about.  Generally, the style of the item is what is important.  For example, Smartwool makes tops very similar to the Icebreaker one I mention.  I know that North Face makes tops much like the Under Armour ones that I like.  As for vests, I very much like the North Face & Mountain Hardwear ones that I have, in addition to the Descente.

I have a workstation at my office, drewble, that has a non-routable IP address.  Our network is setup such that, even from the VPN, I can't access that machine directly — I have to go through one of our dev servers to get to it.  Obviously, having to hop from one machine to another is a bit cumbersome, but as with many thing, this can be alleviated with some simple Unix magic.  A simple alias in my `.bashrc` makes the bouncing simple:
<pre>
alias drewble="ssh -f -N dev1 -L 9999:drewble.genius.local:22; ssh -D7070 -p 9999 drew@localhost"
</pre>

The first SSH command in this alias goes to the dev server, `dev1`, setting up a forward of the local port `9999` to the SSH port, `22`, on my workstation, `drewble`, found via its zeroconf hostname.  The `-f` options causes SSH to background after logging in and `-N` means that SSH won't run any commands after loggging in; I only care about forwarding ports.  The second command utilizes the tunnel setup on port 9999 to get me to the workstation, setting up a dynamic tunnel on port 7070 which can be used as a SOCKS proxy by things like my web browser.

BODY:
I've [written this post before](http://dinomite.net/2007/caps-lock-to-control-on-ubuntu/), but things have changed since the 7.04 Feisty Fawn release, so it's worth an update.  In recent releases of Ubuntu the Gnome Control Center has made it easy to simply click away the unneeded caps lock key, turning it into whatever you want.  I wanted to try KDE 4.2 a few days ago and found no way to turn off the caps lock key.  From my previous post, I knew that it's easy to add a line to the `xorg.conf`which will turn the caps lock into another control, but when I opened the file on my Ubuntu 8.10 machine, I was surprised to find very little in it:
<pre class="brush: bash;">
Section "Files"
EndSection

Section "Module"
    Load  "glx"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier   "Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Configured Video Device"
    Driver      "fglrx"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Default Screen"
    Device     "Configured Video Device"
    Monitor    "Configured Monitor"
    DefaultDepth     24
    SubSection "Display"
        Virtual   1680 1050
    EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre>

If you come from a long line of Linux use, this is a very odd X config indeed since it lists no input devices, but such is the magic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_(software)">HAL</a> which takes care of all that for you.  The option to turn you caps-lock key into a control is set in the keyboard's `InputDevice` section.  The above-listed stock Ubuntu 8.10 xorg config doesn't have an `InputDevice` section, nor does it have the associated `ServerLayout` block.  The following can be appended to your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "keyboard"
    Driver      "keyboard"
    Option      "CoreKeyboard"
    Option      "XkbOptions"    "ctrl:nocaps"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier  "Default Layout"
    Screen      "Default Screen"
    InputDevice "keyboard"
EndSection
</pre>

With that, you will now have a caps lock key no matter what window manager or desktop system you use.  I love the caps lock as a control because I use vi extensively and make use of ^f & ^b, which move up and down pages, and ^e & ^y that move the buffer's view up and down without moving the cursor.  I'm sure emacs users will appreciate this change as well, since they use control alongside 6 or 7 other keys whenever they want to do something.

There are a lot of old-school Unix commands that can be strung together to form miniatures programs a solution where one doesn't already exist.  Often times, they're great for nothing more than trimming the output from command line programs to make ocular searching easier.  `awk` is one of these great little text processing utilities, though I usually find myself using it in only it's simplest fashion: to print a specific record from a line of input.
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|awk '{print $2}'
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
That `awk` command, `'{print $2}'`, is more than a bit cumbersome to type, so I keyed up a quick function in my `.bashrc` to make performing this quick operation easier:
<pre class="brush: bash;">Caligula:~$ df -h|fawk 2
698Gi
298Gi
190Gi</pre>
And the function:
<pre class="brush: bash;">function fawk {
    first="awk '{print "
    last="}'"
    cmd="${first}$${1}${last}"
    eval $cmd
}</pre>

Americans aren't good at saving money.  The average amount of disposable income — income less taxes, not to be confused with [discretionary income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) — saved has dropped from 11% in the 1980s to 1% before the start of the current recession.  A graph is appropriate here:

<a href="http://dinomite.net/2009/03/personal-savings-rate.png"><img src="http://dinomite.net/2009/03/personal-savings-rate.png" height="450" width="662" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" ></a>

I'm not some anti-materialist nazi, but that downward march is the increased confusion that Americans have between "wants" and "needs".  Sure, [real wages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wage) [have decreased](http://www.workinglife.org/wiki/Wages+and+Benefits%3A+Real+Wages+%281964-2004%29)  over this time period, but not nearly at the rate that savings has slumped.

The uptick for 2009?  That's the just-released data for January of this year which pegs the rate at 5%, up from 1.8% in 2008 and 0.5% the previous year.  August of 2005 even featured a rate of <strong>negative</strong> 2.7%, a feat matched only by the -0.2% rate in 2001.  Though I would generally argue that people thinking about their future rather than [instant gratification](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09view.html?ex=1362718800&en=e0525c458b2d83df&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) is a wonderful change, increased saving isn't what an economy needs to break out of a recession.

<p>I totally agree. It's unfortunate, however, that the current economic factors not only require that people spend more, but that they also save more. The housing market being in such a slump results in a lot of people with good credit suddenly able to get a great rate on a nice house for much less than they needed before. Putting that extra effort in saving monies gets them there faster. The threat of losing jobs (ADP noted yesterday that something like 697000 jobs were shed in the private sector in February alone) is a huge concern and a major catalyst for hording cash. It also doesn't help that no one trusts the banks with their money anymore.</p>

<p>You're absolutely right and truthfully it is hard to fault anyone for saving more right now since that is certainly the prudent course of action.  I don't think everyone is completely off the hook, though, because the historical rate makes it clear that most haven't been saving for many years.</p>

Like any good [geek](http://www.geekcode.com), I have a naming system for my computers and associated devices.  Real systems &#x2014; which I define as those that run SSH &#x2014; are named after [Roman Emperors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors); things that are computer-like but don't run SSH are named after [Roman generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_generals).

I have also taken to naming each of the disks attached to a machine after a land mass somehow connected to the Emperor it is named after.  My main desktop is [Caligula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula) with the disks [Capri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri), where Caligula lived under the care of [Tiberius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius), [Mauretania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania), which Tiberius annexed, and [Germania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania), where Caligula accompanied his father on military campaigns as a young child.  When I got a USB drive for keeping off-site backups, I needed to name it and though ships of the [Roman Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Navy) would be appropriate.  What a pleasant surprise to find that Caligula had built a ship to transport the obelisk in [St. Peter's Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter%27s_Square) which when it was found in the 1950's was named [Caligula's "Giant Ship"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula%27s_Giant_Ship).

I name my hard drives after Roman Emperors too.
I have 4 HDs split into partitions.
Caesar (not an emperor, but was virtually the first emperor) Diocletian, E isn't - (I refused to name it Elagabulus !) Flavius, Gallienus, Hadrian, etc.
I'd like to know more about Caligulas "giant ship" found when digging up for Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci airport. Can't seem to find any info.
Its seperate from the Nemi ships.

Crontabs are incredibly useful devices - the easiest way to regularly run a command at a specified time.  The unfortunate part is that, as an operating system level function, their content is easily lost if you aren't careful about backups, or haphazardly reinstall your Unix system.  A simple trick I learned is to keep your crontab entries in a file, say, `.crontab` in your home directory, rather than just editing your crontab directly (i.e. `crontab -e`).  That way, you can be sure that all your important data, including your own user crontab, is in your home directory, and that's the one important thing to backup.  To install a new crontab, simply run `crontab ~/.crontab` after having edited that file and your cron system will install your changes.

After seeing the [BlackRapid R-Strap](http://www.blackrapid.com/) mentioned on [Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/content/buy-this/diy-camera-r-strap/) I knew that I wanted one for greater convenience when walking about with my camera.  I hate neck straps because they get in the way when you aren't using them and make you look like a fat tourist when you are.  I might as well break out the khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt.  Aside from the not-exactly-cheap $50 price tag, I figured that and R-Strap was something I should DIY.

My version of the R-Strap is a simple affair, consisting of the plate off my Manfrotto ballhead and some gear from the climbing section of REI.  To begin with, I got myself a [2 foot long, 18mm runner](http://www.rei.com/product/722354) which I wear like a bandolier.  To this, I attach a simple [locking carabiner](http://www.rei.com/product/782255) - I just chose the smallest and cheapest one.  I thought about using chintzy keychain carabiners, but then realized I'll be hangning thousands of dollars of gear off of it and went with the slightly more expensive real thing.

Finally, I tied a small loop of [nylon cord](http://www.rei.com/product/784296) to the D-ring on my tripod plate, to which I clip the carabiner.  If your tripod plate has a large enough ring, you could clip directly to it.

<p>forgive me for pointing this out, but you say you spent a little more money on  more robust carabina,  then you use a peice of nylon cord to attach it?  so then this nylon cord is the very thing that the whole camera is depending on,  i thought maybe something more substantial should have been used really.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say thanks for this useful idea.  I also want to back you up on that nylon cord.  As a climber, I will agree that with the right knot it's not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Using the runner is a good idea because it reduces your possible points of failure (a regular neck strap, like the one from your laptop bag, will create two points of failure).  As a bigger guy, however, a two foot runner won't work for me and a four foot one is probably too big.  I'm going to try something like the klein adjustable shoulder strap from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Klein-58889-Padded-Adjustable-Shoulder/dp/B0002RI6Y8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=sporting-goods&amp;qid=1260298870&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>.  It's a little less reliable than using the runner, but once I find a way to connect the metal clips (I'll probably either use a metal cord or more nylon), I think it'll be reliable enough.</p>

<p>Even if you have to buy a shoulder strap like the one I mentioned, it'll still end up costing less than an actual r-strap.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>Glad to hear someone else giving it a shot!  Dan Benjamin (of Tack Sharp) just started selling yet another single-point sling device, the <a href="http://www.luma-labs.com/products/lumaloop" rel="nofollow">Luma Loop</a> last week, and while it looks to be a bit less bulky then the carabiner my setup has, it's also $60.</p>

<p>As for size, I'm pretty slim and the 2ft. runner is a bit small, even for me.  I might just buy 2.5 feet 1-inch of webbing and bond or sew it myself.</p>

BODY:
If you're into cars, a weekend at the racetrack is as good as it gets.  The local chapters of car clubs ([BMW CCA](http://bmwcca.org), [PCA](http://pca.org), [FCA](http://ferrariclubofamerica.org), [SCCA](http://scca.org) etc.) rent a track for the weekend, organize instructors from member volunteers, and allow you to Drive Like You Mean It on a real racetrack while teaching you to be a much better driver.  Track weekends are variously called Driver's Schools, High Performance Driver Education (HPDE), or simply track days.  The weekends aren't cheap &#x2014; the [NCC BMW CCA](http://nccbmwcca.org) I used to drive with charges $430 and the [GGC BMW CCA](http://ggcbmwcca.org) $525 &#x2014; but are worth every penny.  Your first time can be quite daunting, since it's hard to know what to expect or how to prepare.  Hopefully this overview of my most recent day with the Golden Gate Chapter at [Infineon Raceway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infineon_Raceway) will be helpful.

Inspection
---------
Two to three weeks prior to the track day, I get my car inspected by a mechanic I trust.  They usually charge an hour of labor, but if you're lucky you can get it thrown in with some maintenance you require &#x2014; ask other club members.  All clubs I know of require an inspection to ensure that your car is in tip top shape for being pushed to the limit.  Common to all such inspections is that you have sufficient brake pad material left (more than half the pad) and that the brake fluid has been changed within the past six months.  Other than those two specifics, most cars in good condition won't need anything special done to work on the track, especially your first time.

Packing
-------
On the Thursday before my track weekend, I start packing.  I have a track/autocross box that contains paper towels, windshield cleaner (Stoner Invisible Glass), a quart of oil, a good air gauge, duct tape, the manual for my car, a couple of common wrenches, a torque wrench, a breaker bar and a bottle of white liquid shoe polish.  Every day at the track I will use the glass cleaner to keep my windows super-clean, the air gauge to set my tire pressure, and the torque wrench to check my wheel bolts.  I often end up adding a bit of oil throughout the course of the weekend and I've found the duct tape useful on a few occasions to fix that stupid plastic undertray on my E36.

As for the shoe polish, it's one of the best tools for adjust air pressure.  Simply put a bit of shoe polish on the sidewall of the tire and onto the shoulder block of the tread; when you get off the track, see where the polish has disappeared and adjust the tire pressure accordingly.

Additionally, I pack my portable air compressor (though most tracks have air available), a couple of towels, my helmet, and tech inspection form &#x2014; the last two being a absolute requirements, since you can't drive without them.

Personal stuff I bring includes a cooler filled with lots of water, some sandwiches, apples, and energy bars.  Being [something of a photographer](http://flickr.com/photos/dinomite) I bring along my camera, since hot cars driving on a racetrack makes for good pictures.  I also toss in some reading material and the Eagle Scout in me requires a bag with a complete change of clothes.  If you're coming home each day (which I do, since the track is only about an hour away), you probably don't need the extra clothes, but do bring a sweatshirt and jacket, even if the forecast is for highs in the 80s.  For those of us who live in urban areas, we aren't used to being up at 6 in the morning &#x2014; it can be pretty cold then.  Also, unlike that NASCAR crap, you will drive rain or shine and in cold weather, always with the windows down.  It won't be a fun time if you're cold.

Friday
------
On Friday, I come home from work, pack all of my gear into the car, and head to bed around 10PM.  I won't actually get there until 11 and probably won't fall asleep until later still, but since I have to leave the house at 5:30AM to get to the track by 7, I make the effort to get a good night's sleep.  Why 7AM?  The drivers meeting will be at 8AM, the instructors will do ride-along intro laps thereafter and the track opens at 9AM.  All track events require everyone to attend the drivers meeting and, like the rest of the day, things run a very strict time table.  Renting a track is very expensive and everyone wants to make the most of it, so be on time and build yourself some extra cushion, especially if it's your first time out.

BODY:
Distilled down to the simplest terms, <a href="http://crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> workouts are about <strong>intensity, variability, and functionality</strong>.

The values of CrossFit's World Class Fitness, are often [summarized in 100 words](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/start-how.html):
<blockquote>Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&amp;J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc. hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.</blockquote>
If all that is too simplified, let me elaborate.  CrossFit is a workout regiment that embodies the above mentioned values.  Unlike so many "gym rats" who think in disparate terms of cardiovascular and strength training, CrossFit does away with these distinctions for a methodology that is driven by results.  Personal trainers at <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Globo%20Gym">Globo Gym</a> encourage long cardio stints of an hour or more "balanced" with similarly long sessions of strength training using <a href="http://www.nautilus.com">Nautilus</a> machines.  In contrast, CrossFit workouts are mixed modal functional movements, performed at high intensity.

<strong>What is the difference and what make CrossFit better?</strong>

First, the focus on functional movements rather than isolated muscles.  CrossFit not only trains your entire body to actually be used, but trains you in how to use your body to it's fullest extent.  Instead of a leg press machine, shoulder press machine, and lat pull-down, CrossFit workouts involve similar exercises, the squat, push press, and pull-up, either with bodyweight or barbells.  Performing those latter exercises, which are done outside of the support of weight machines, means that technique, not just raw strength, is an important factor.  Your body has to employ numerous minor muscles in concert to complete the moves safely and effectively.  Ask yourself: do you have a machine guiding you to lift that dresser when helping a friend move?

Variety is a key part of CrossFit.  The Workout Of the Day repeats on the scale of months and years - you can do CrossFit for quite some time before you repeat any single workout, and at the rate we're going it'll be a long time before any 3 days have the same prescription.  This unique aspect of CrossFit is vitally important not only because keeps you from getting bored with exercise but it also keeps your body in limbo - there's know way to prepare for the next move when it's always different.  This variety increases your ability to function optimally in the face of any task that is thrown at you, be it a new sport or a true emergency.  Greg Glassman, the founder of CrossFit describes the importance of variability thusly:
<blockquote>We don't have the agility of gymnasts, the power of a weightlifter, or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility, power, and endurance than any gymnast, weightlifter or marathoner. We do your stuff almost as good as you, you can’t do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can.</blockquote>
What he's saying that CrossFit athletes may not have the same ultimate performance in a single domain that specialists athletes have, we have a much broader portfolio of abilities. While the average marathon runner may be able to keep that sustained effort for hours, but they can't jump more than 18 inches or lift their body weight off the ground. The weightlifter may be able to toss twice his weight overhead, but would suffer if asked to run a mile or do 20 pull-ups.

The intensity of CrossFit is, to me, the central factor that differentiates it from the way most people exercise.  At the Globo Gym, you'll see folks do their cardio workout, perhaps running on the treadmill, spinning on a stationary bike, or pedaling on a elliptical machine for 30 to 45 minutes.  Then, they'll amble around the weight machines for an hour or more, doing 3 sets of 10 with a minute of rest in between; guys who are trying to "get big" will split the weight session between "lats &amp; back" on day, "chest &amp; biceps" another, and "legs" the third.  It all seems very organized, takes a lot of dedication and time.

In contrast, CrossFit workouts are usually 20-30 minutes and the longest ones take 45 to complete.  That's it.  What do we do in that time?  A whole lot more work than most people do in their entire 2-3 hour gym sessions, thanks to the ever present intensity.  Even in CrossFit strength workouts like <strong>DT</strong> (3 rounds for time of <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#WOD1">155lbs. deadlift x 12, clean x 12, jerk x 6</a>), there's a note that the workout is "for time" — no ambling around between sets in this workout.  The reason this intensity is important is because is teaches you how to use the maximum extent of your body; to actually employ your muscles to their fullest.  Intensity also plays into another big question that people have about CrossFit:

<strong>What about cardio?</strong>

Ahh, yes, what about cardio?  Surely because we never do any long sessions of running, CrossFitters can't have any endurance or stamina.  Wrong.  The widely touted measure of aerobic stamina and endurance is VO2 max, the amount of oxygen that your body can consume during sustained aerobic exercise — medium intensity stuff like distance running or biking.  There's a misconception that long bouts of aerobic exercise are what is required to build stamina and endurance, but this simply isn't true.  In the same way muscles must be taken beyond their limits and torn to stimulate growth, your ability to process oxygen must be pushed out of equilibrium in order to increase your capacity to process it (see <a href="http://journal.crossfit.com/2004/06/what-about-cardio-by-greg-glas.tpl">CrossFit Journal issue 22</a>; ask me if you're really interested).  Running at some level below your aerobic threshold (i.e. less than 100% VO2 max) will do little if anything to increase this ability.  To push it out of equilibrium and induce growth you have to workout at 200% or more of your aerobic ability.  In metabolic terms, you need to work the high-intensity phosphagenic and glycolytic pathways in order to improve the medium-low intensity aerobic pathway.

<strong>The Bottom Line</strong>

To really get CrossFi, you must understand <a href="http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ-trial.pdf">what fitness really is</a> (PDF) in the CrossFit view.  First, CrossFit sees fitness as including ten metrics: cardiovascular endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.  Second is the ability to not just perform well at certain measures of fitness, but to perform admirably at any task that is thrown at you.  The CrossFit games, which determines who is the fittest CrossFitter each year, embraces this — the competitors don't know what the competition will entail until the day of the competition.  Rounding out CrossFit's standard for being "fit" is competency in each of the three metabolic pathways: phosphagenic, glycolytic, and oxidative.  Fulfilling CrossFit's standard means that one has total fitness, fitness across the broadest range of measures and challenges.

If you're trying to "get big", then by all means, stick to a rotating schedule of isolating muscles, hit the protein powder hard, skip the cardio, and enjoy the ditzy chicks you can pick up at the bar.

If you dig that ematiated Ethiopian look, like to run marathons, and want to pick up the vegan chick from Whole Foods to have some very boney sex, then keep at those super cardio sessions!

If you're truly interested in challenging yourself, being in the best shape possible, and improving your abilities across numerous domains, then <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-affiliates/">find a local CrossFit gym</a>, and get in their boot camp.  You'll thank me later.

BODY:
For the first time a few months ago I traveled by plane and brought lock picks in my carry on luggage.  After having read [this article](http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/267/2/) about sneaking lock picks in the extension tubes of rolling luggage, I wondered what would really be required to just sneak picks through.  Though flying with lock picks isn't illegal the TSA agents are not known for their accurate knowledge of the rules concerning air travel.  I really wanted to have picks at my destination so that I could do a seminar on picking; I didn't want them to be taken away by an overzealous agent.

Lock picks don't have that much mass so I figured if I removed all of normal metal, including my belt, that I'd get through the metal detector OK with the picks in my pocket.  I tried this tactic on the trip to my destination and was successful.  After removing my belt, I just put my four picks & three torque wrenches in my shirt pocket and waltzed through the metal detector to no notice of the TSA agent.  That was easy.

The return trip was equally uneventful, though I used a different method - I simply put my picks into the bag that I put through the X-ray.  Again, this was of no interest to the TSA; either they didn't notice or they know what picks are and that it's OK to carry them.  I'll assume the former.

Long story short: you can easily sneak a few picks through in your pocket if you have no other metal on your person.  Odds are you can get some through the X-ray machine without any hassle, as well.

Though [I use Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/dinomite) it's not a perfect representation of my listening habits.  Between the occasional server downtime, not uncommon in the Audioscrobbler days, I wanted to be able to get some accurate statistics about my music library.  It's easy to create smart playlists to find the number of songs you have of each genre or by each artist in your library, but much more interesting is to see what you actually listen to the most.  There are a number of artist whom I only have a limited collection of, but enjoy quite a lot.  DJ Miko being a great example - 10th by number of tracks, but a strong 3rd by playcount.  I just can't get enough of those Eurodance beats.  Conversely, Scooter is a prolific producer, but a long way from my favorite artist.

Genre-wise, I've got a <strong>lot</strong> of trance, but apparently end up listening to Ska more.  Is that really true?  Well, it is by playcount, but I should probably to a listing based upon playcount times song length; Trance tracks tend to be lengthy, especially if you count the numerous DJ mixes I have.  By this same token, I'd venture a guess that the average song length of my library, 5 minutes 13 seconds is on the longer end of the spectrum.  Finally, the ratio of songs to artists is a quite reflection of whether a library is represented by an encyclopedic collection for each artist (high ratio) or a schizophrenic mix of singles (lower ratio).  I have no idea what an absolute scale for this number is, but I'd love to hear results from others.

Also, my library has grown quite a bit:
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true">
Number of tracks: 10737
Total size: 85605.68 MB         Average size: 7.97 MB
Total time: 38d 23h 3m 0s       Average time: 5m13s
Ratio of songs/artists: 4.576726342711

Most popular artists, by number of tracks:
        137     ATB
        118     Scooter
        116     blink-182
        115     Armin van Buuren
        111     Paul van Dyk

Most popular artists, by playcount:
        1585    blink-182
        1279    Goldfinger
        873     DJ Miko & Mini Me
        837     Less Than Jake
        753     Big D and the Kids Table

Most popular genres, by number of tracks:
        1627    Trance
        1219    Dance
        1073    Ska
        628     Rock
        583     Vocal Trance

Most popular genres, by playcount:
        8448    Ska
        6334    Dance
        5328    Trance
        2846    Punk
        2723    Rock
</pre>

It's certainly been a while since I [started this project](http://dinomite.net/2006/itunes-library-statistics/) and the [module](http://search.cpan.org/~dinomite/Mac-iTunes-Library/lib/Mac/iTunes/Library.pm) that I spun off of it has been around for a good while.  I've compiled [the script](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/itunesstats) into a PAR that should run without needing Perl or any modules on any 64 bit Mac OS X machine.  From a terminal:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
wget http://dinomite.net/2009/01/itunesstats
chmod +x itunesstats
./itunesstats ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music\ Library.xml 5
</pre>

If that doesn't work for you, you can simply [install Mac::iTunes::Library with CPAN](http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/macosx/); CPAN might require configuration but, except for mirror selection, the defaults will work:

<pre class="brush: bash; light: true">
$ sudo -H cpan -i Mac::iTunes::Library
</pre>

With the module installed, you can download and run the [example script](http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DINOMITE/Mac-iTunes-Library-0.62/examples/iTunesStats.pl).

Details on the code: [The module](http://search.cpan.org/~dinomite/Mac-iTunes-Library/) allows you to parse the iTunes XML library which is generated by iTunes every time the library changes.  iTunes itself uses a binary file to manage your music and the XML is only generated as a courtesy.  Thus, my module can represent a library and the items within it in full, but I only have a parser for the XML and provide no way of emitting a new XML library.  [brian d foy](http://www252.pair.com/comdog/) has [a module](http://search.cpan.org/~bdfoy/Mac-iTunes/) that is able to parse the binary iTunes - as long as it's version 4.5.  For the uninformed, we're on iTunes 8 these days.  Updating that module might be my next project.

<p>In my opinion, the basic flaw of Amazon's recommendations is that they're not intelligent. People who bought a Canon lens might also have bought a Nikon battery, but it doesn't mean the 2 have anything to do with each other.</p>

BODY:
Since he was [mentioned on The Daily Show]() a few weeks ago, [Rick Ross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_(rapper)) has quickly become my favorite rapper.  The king of repetition, Ross hails from Miami and makes much of his activities trafficking drugs despite [allegations that he worked for the man](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0721081rickross1.html) during part of his life.  Like many rappers, Rick Ross talks a lot about his expensive cars and I noticed a trend in the vehicles of which he spoke.

<a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series.jpg"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series-300x172.jpg" alt="" title="BMW 7 Series" width="300" height="172" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-341" /></a>
In his first album, Port of Miami, Ross' makes a number of references to his white on white BMW 745i such as this line from the hit single *Hustlin'*:

<blockquote>
Who tha fuck you think ya fuckin with?  I'm tha fuckin boss<br>
745 white on white, thats fuckin Ross
</blockquote>

To be sure, any BMW 7 series is a fine car, but the 745i is the base model of the line.  Is Rick Ross a poor rapper?  Not too fast, in the song *White House*, he mentions a Rolls Royce Phantom:

<blockquote>
we in the white house<br>
big phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
</blockquote>

Is this song a fantasy about occupying the [White House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) proper, or is it simply hyperbole about his mansion, with a nod to cocaine usage and trade?  Given the previous mention of a 745i, I can only assume that the Phantom was but a fantasy for Rick Ross in 2006.

<a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/maybach-116.jpg"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/maybach-116-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Maybach" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-347" /></a>
Times change.  In 2008, Rick Ross released the album *Trilla* and it sounds like he's had a significant upgrade.  The song *Luxury Tax*, makes specific mention of a 760, the top of the line BMW 7 Series:

<blockquote>
Got my whole arm rocked.<br>
Keep the 760 double parked in the wrong spot.
</blockquote>

The cover of the album also features the rapper in the back seat of a [Maybach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_57_and_62), the sole car from the eponymous ultra-luxury brand owned by [Mercedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes).  The album also includes a song *Maybach Music*, Ross says that he has 20 whips, one of which is a [Maserati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati).

BODY:
The other day I wanted to diff a pair of files on two different hosts, stg1 and stg2.  Normally, I would do so by copying on of the files to the other host, or grabbing them both onto my workstation with `scp`; "there must be a better way," I thought.

Enter command substitution, a process by which you use the output from an executed command as the input to another.  Many people have used this in a simple manner such as ``ls /usr/src/linux-`uname -r` ``which takes the output of `uname -r`, namely the kernel release you're running, and uses that to flesh out the `ls` command.  There is a more complicated form, however, that I use for diffing remote files.  In the aforementioned example, I used the following command to diff the files:

<pre>
vimdiff <(ssh stg1 cat /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd) <(ssh stg2 cat /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd)
</pre>

Much like a subselect in MySQL, the `cat` commands are executed on the remote machine and then piped to `vimdiff` allowing for single command, no-file-copying diffs.

After a new challenge, [Saving Time](http://codegolf.com/saving-time) was posted a few weeks ago, I'm finally getting to another round of [Code Golf](http://codegolf.com/).  As usual, my preferred language is Perl; don't read below if you don't want hints!
-----
EXTENDED BODY:


My first draft grabs the hour and minutes using capturing in a regex, then turns them both into positions on a twelve hour clockface.  The clock location is passed to the function `symbol` which, through use of some nasty nested ternaries, what should be printed at the passed position on the clock face. (470 characters):

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /(\d+):(\d+)/;
$H = $1 % 12;
$M = ($2 - ($2 % 5)) / 5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . symbol(0) . $/;
$z .= $;x4 . symbol(11) . $;x7 . symbol(1) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . symbol(10) . $;x13 . symbol(2) . $/.$/;
$z .= symbol(9) . $;x15 . symbol(3) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . symbol(8) . $;x13 . symbol(4) . $/.$/;
$z .= $;x4 . symbol(7) . $;x7 . symbol(5) . $/;
$z .= $;x8 . symbol(6);

print $z;

sub symbol {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

Perl provides the automatic variables ``$` `` and `$'` (aka  `$PREMATCH` and `$POSTMATCH` with `use English`) which are, unsurprisingly, the portions of a scalar before and after what your regex matched.  I simplified the input regex by simply matching the colon and grabbing the hours & minutes from ``$` `` and `$'`.    shorten subroutine name (398 characters):

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . sy(0) . $/; 
$z .= $;x4 . sy(11) . $;x7 . sy(1) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . sy(10) . $;x13 . sy(2) . $/.$/;
$z .= sy(9) . $;x15 . sy(3) . $/.$/;
$z .= $; . sy(8) . $;x13 . sy(4) . $/.$/;
$z .= $;x4 . sy(7) . $;x7 . sy(5) . $/;
$z .= $;x8 . sy(6);

print $z;

sub sy {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

I spun off the drawing of most lines into a single function, which takes the number of preceding spaces, the leftmost hour mark on the line, the number of interstitial spaces and the final hour mark on the line (380 characters):

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;

$;=' ';

$z = $;x8 . sy(0) . $/; 
$z .= li(4,11,7,1) . $/;
$z .= li(1,10,13,2) . $/;
$z .= li(0,9,15,3) . $/;
$z .= li(1,8,13,4) . $/;
$z .= li(4,7,7,5);
$z .= $;x8 . sy(6);

print $z;

sub li {
    $;x$_[0] . sy($_[1]) . $;x$_[2] . sy($_[3]) . $/;
}   
sub sy {
    $_ = shift;
    $H==$_ ? ($H==$M ? 'x' : 'h') : ($M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o');
}
</pre>

Before getting totally mucked up (311 characters):

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<> =~ /:/;
$H = $` % 12;
$M = int $'/5;
print ' 'x8 . sy(0) . $/ . li(4,11,7,1) . $/ . li(1,10,13,2) . $/ . li(0,9,15,3) . $/ . li(1,8,13,4) . $/ . li(4,7,7,5) . ' 'x8 . sy(6);

sub li {' 'x$_[0] . sy($_[1]) . ' 'x$_[2] . sy($_[3]) . $/;}
sub sy {$_ = shift; $H==$_ ? $H==$M ? 'x' : 'h' : $M==$_ ? 'm' : 'o';}
</pre>

My final effort which is 244 characters when concatenated onto a single line:

<pre class="brush: perl;">
<>=~/:/;
$H=$`%12;
$M=int $'/5;
sub li{' 'x$_[0].sy($_[1]).' 'x$_[2].sy($_[3]).$/}
sub sy{$_=shift;$H==$_?$H==$M?'x':'h':$M==$_?'m':'o'}
print ' 'x8 .sy(0).$/.li(4,11,7,1).$/.li(1,10,13,2).$/.li(0,9,15,3).$/.li(1,8,13,4).$/.li(4,7,7,5).' 'x8 .sy(6)

It's always interesting to see what keywords debaters drop to get their points across.  To analyze tonight's debate between Biden &amp; Palin, I grabbed a [transcript from CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/debate.transcript/?iref=mpstoryview) that was posted shortly after.  The transcript listed each speaker's name (Biden, Ifill or Palin), followed by their first sentence in that statement, with subsequent statements on new lines.  To make it easily `grep`able,  wrote a quick Perl script to join each speaker's full passages into a single line, beginning with their name.  With that done, it's trivial to search for words the candidates spoke.  [The transcript is here](http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/vpdebate.txt).

First up, "change" and "hope", adages of the Obama campaign that McCain and Palin have picked up in recent weeks:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (change|hope): 17</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (change|hope): 25</span>

Which presidential candidate got more mentions?<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (John|McCain): 72</span><br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (Barack|Obama): 45</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (John|McCain): 42</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (Barack|Obama): 24</span>

Palin's state makes a lot of energy and high prices are on the mind of voters:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (energy): 9</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (energy): 29</span>

Both talked a lot about the war:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (war|iraq|afghanistan): 51</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (war|iraq|afghanistan): 58</span>

Palin cares about her family:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (family|child): 8</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (family|child): 15</span>

Biden said "clean coal" a couple of times to Palin's one; they both mentioned "coal" in general more than that:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (coal): 7</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (coal): 2</span>

The economy was a talking point:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (economy): 4</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (economy): 13</span>

Only one of the candidates knows about deregulation of Wall Street in recent years:<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (deregulation): 7</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (deregulation): 0</span>

Wall Street or Main Street?<br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (wall street): 3</span><br>
* <span style="color: #0000ff;">Biden (main street): 1</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (wall street): 5</span><br>
* <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palin (main street): 2</span>

Any suggestions?

<p>10-3-08 (AP) - Up to 100,000 bodies were found late last night and early this morning by relatives and friends around the United States - the latest deadly toll of what law enforcement authorities are saying is a the result of a drinking game gone terrible wrong.   Copies of the drinking game supplied to our office, the rules provided to contestants was to drink half a shot, beer or other beverage whenever the following words were issued on the Vice Presidential debate between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. The words are "energy, reform, alaska, wallstreet corruption and maverick"</p>

<p>Details are still coming in and the casualty numbers are expected to increase.</p>

Best known for their eponymous debut album, [Dune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(German_band)) is a mid-90's techno outfit whose music incorporates many of the styles endemic to [House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) and [Dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) at the time.  **Expedicion** is a good exploration of the style, featuring lots of fast beats throughout, a bit singing vocals and even some good-old meaningless talking throughout some tracks.  The entire album is also sprinkled with radio recordings including the classic NASA piece, "we're go for auto-sequence start" on the opening track *Rising*.

The album opens with my favorite track, *Million Miles from Home* which incorporates some speedy [808](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-909) beats, broken by slow and emotive sections and all with a melodic vocal loop.  The track *In My Dreams* has a very [IDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music)/[drum and bass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music) style to it and is topped off by vocals that are a bit more odd, but appropriate.  *In The Air*, which is split into two disparate tracks, lends a somewhat trancey feel with it's lower tempo and slower progression.  The balance of the album, including *Hand in Hand*, *Rainbow to the Stars* and *Around the World* are almost [Happy Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hardcore) anthems, save for their just-a-bit-too-slow tempos.

I listen to some podcasts daily that have annoying messages in them that never change.  With a bit of research, I came across the [MP3::Splitter](http://search.cpan.org/~ilyaz/MP3-Splitter-0.04/Splitter.pm) module on [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/) which has somewhat confusing documentation but provides a method `mp3split()` that pulls specified pieces of a file.  You provide `mp3split()` with the input MP3 filename, options as a hash and then any number of arrays that specify which portions of the MP3 to copy into new files.  The easiest syntax for specifying a portion is to pass the start position and the length of the desired chunk, both in seconds.  From the command line, I did this:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
perl -MMP3::Splitter -e "mp3split('foo.mp3', {}, [20,25], [95,600], [950,INF])"
</pre>

which creates three new MP3 files, 01_foo.mp3, 02_foo.mp3 and 03_foo.mp3.  These can then be joined to create a new MP3:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
cat 01_foo.mp3 > new.mp3
cat 02_foo.mp3 >> new.mp3
cat 03_foo.mp3 >> new.mp3
</pre>

Which will leave you with `new.mp3` that is a concatenation of the three pieces.  Using `cat` to join them means the resulting file will probably have some artifacts at the join points but that's not a problem for my use.  If it is, you can use something like `mp3join` to properly join the files.

The passage of the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008) ([H.R. 1424](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._1424)) was a good thing for rum lovers:

<blockquote>
SEC. 308. INCREASE IN LIMIT ON COVER OVER OF RUM EXCISE TAX TO PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.<br>
    (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 7652(f) is amended by striking ``January 1, 2008'' and inserting ``January 1, 2010''.<br>
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply to distilled spirits brought into the United States after December 31, 2007.
</blockquote>

This change extends the limit on taxation of rum from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands to a maximum of $13.50 per gallon.  Figuring that out was not an easy process, requiring looking from the bill's amendments, to to the original text thereof, and finally to the internal revenue code being referenced.

On the eve of the election, I am thinking about [voting systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system) better than that which is currently employed in United States [general elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election).

Among [single-winner voting systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-winner_voting_system), the most common is [instant-runoff voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) and the simplest, making it the most reasonable choice as a replacement for the single-vote system that we currently use.  In an instant-runoff election, you fill out a ballot showing the order of preference for the candidates available.  When votes are tallied, your number one candidate is used to tally votes; if that candidate did not achieve a majority, then he is eliminated from the election and your second choice is taken.  This continues until a candidate has achieved a majority, thereby winning the election.

IRV allows for voters to cast a ballot for a candidate whom they truly believe in without feeling that they are throwing their vote away.  This solves the Ralph Nader problem from the 2000 election.  Nader was the prime choice for many Americans but his status as a third-party candidate meant that he had no chance of winning the election.  Many who might have wanted to vote for Nader instead voted for one of the two major-party candidates, because their vote would otherwise be wasted.  The few who did vote for Nader, were then blamed for Al Gore's loss of the election, since they most likely would have voted for the Democratic candidate were it not for the Green Party's presence.  Instant-runoff voting keeps third-party candidates from "stealing" votes from the major parties and makes third-parties viable, since voters can feel confident in voting for such candidates.

Another area of voting that is lacking in the United States is the security and integrity of the voting system.  There are endless reports of electronic voting machines losing votes, miscounting votes or being tampered with.  Creating a system that is both secure and verifiable while at the same time anonymous is not a trivial task but there is a group of people who deal with such odd logic puzzles: cryptographers.  After the fiasco of electronic voting machines in the 2004 election, many people spent time thinking about methods for secure, verifiable voting.  One of those was [Ron Rivest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest), the R in RSA, who came up with the [ThreeBallot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot) voting protocol.

The entire protocol is [detailed in Rivest's paper](http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest/Rivest-TheThreeBallotVotingSystem.pdf), but the gist of the system is that the voter fills out three ballots which are identical, save for a unique number identifying each.  Through some cryptographic logic magic, the ballots are marked such that any single ballot of the triplet does not divulge whom the voter cast their ballot for; because the ballot is unique, however, the voter is given a copy of one of the three to take home.  This receipt can later be checked against the ballots that are published so that the voter can verify that their choice was indeed counted.  Again, this publishing doesn't divulge information about whom they voted for, despite the fact that all of the information of the election is published, allowing anyone to perform a recount.

<p>IRV is a very important pro-democracy election reform. No voting method is perfect, but political scientists and voting method experts widely agree that the plurality winner-take-all voting method generally used in the U.S. is the worst of all. IRV eliminates the "spoiler" problem, and opens the door to multiple choices and parties, broadening and strengthening political debate. IRV also has a real chance to gain widespread use in the U.S. (unlike some other pet election reform methods that have a tiny group of Internet supporters), and just yesterday was adopted by Memphis (TN).</p>

This video clip from a 1977 film [Gizmo!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074573/) shows a 1930s newsreel clip of a man doing Parkour moves, well before such a thing had a name or community.  It's incredible to see exactly the same movements being performed 75 years before I had ever imaged doing them.  About 20 seconds in he does a wall-run top-out in the exact same fashion I've seen numerous people do on the high box at [Primal](http://www.primal-fitness.com/).  Neat.

BODY:
[Harley Shaiken](http://geography.berkeley.edu/PeopleHistory/faculty/H_Shaiken.html) had [a piece on Marketplace](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/18/pm_shaiken_commentary/) yesterday arguing that high labor costs, the sticking point for Senate Republicans concerning last week's bailout, are not a prime reason for the US auto maker's downfall.  I don't feel the need to break apart Shaiken's short argument, because he sums it up well in the final sentence, "A superior product, high productivity and high wages pave the road to a healthy economy and a decent society."  We can all agree that workers in Detroit have high wages and the indigenous car manufacturers even have [good productivity](http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2008/06/harbour_report_detroit_3_erasi.html); but a superior product?  Not a chance.

The prime reason that Asian cars sell so well in the United States is because they have a superior product at nearly every price point when compared to the US companies.  Often features are not what makes domestic cars pale compared to their Korean & Japanese counterparts; usually a general air of cheapness, from bad switchgear and low-grade plastic to unsorted suspension American cars are made to a much tighter budget.  The reason?  High labor costs at the plants of domestic auto makers, an average of $78 vs. $45 for non-union plants, force those car makers to make up for these costs elsewhere.  The only way to compensate for [such a large disparity](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200812191552DOWJONESDJONLINE000977_FORTUNE5.htm) in costs is for the US manufacturers to cut back on the amount of money put into their product, hence the low-quality cars.

with a <a href="http://twitter.com/dinomite/status/8138332322">specific quote</a> from The Big Lebowski.  While there are a number of Big Lebowski scripts around
the internet, none of them provide markup to allow linking to sections of the script.  With the
help of some simple Perl, I created a version of the script with anchor tags throughout, making it

Where's the scene with Knox Harrington, the Video Artist? You know, he picks up the phone and it's Sandro calling about the Biennale? Was that added after this version of the script?

That happens during the <a href="http://dinomite.net/~dinomite/lebowski.html#72">second scene at Maude's loft</a>, but you're right, Knox Harrington isn't mentioned in the script, so it must have been added later.

Phil Zuckerman, a [sociology professor](http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/) at [Pitzer College](http://www.pitzer.edu) and author of [Society Without God](http://www.amazon.com/Society-without-God-Religious-Contentment/dp/0814797148), an analysis of religiosity and its effects on a society.  Zuckermand gave a talk at the annual [Freedom From Religion Foundation](http://ffrf.org) convention in 2009, highlighting many of the important statistics he analyzed for the book, which I will paraphrase below, using the section headings from his speech.  As Zuckerman himself says, these are merely correlations—his prime aim towards Americans is to make clear that a lack of religion does not hinder a society.

## Atheists are better educated

- Only 7% of members of the [National Academy of Sciences](http://www.nationalacademies.org) claim a belief in a personal god.
- While 27% of Americans claim "no religion", 42% of college graduates are in the irreligious cohort.

## Atheists are less homophobic and more moral

- 60% of religiously unaffiliated Americans support gay marriage compared with only 26% of Protestants and 42% of Catholics.
- Among secular Americans, support for the invasion of Iraq was 38%, compared with 68% of evangelical Protestants, 58% of Catholics, and 47% of Jews.
- Nonreligious Americans support stem cell research much more (84%) than those who report being "very religious" (55%) or "somewhat religious" (76%).
- The US prison population consists of only 0.2% atheists.
- Murder rates are lowest in the more secular states, and highest in the most religious.

## Atheists in concentration results in societal success

First, let's see the rates of residents reporting "no faith" in states.

Highest:

- Oregon (31%)
- Washington (30%)
- Vermont (30%)
- Colorado (26.6%)
- Delaware (26.5%)
- Idaho (25.4%)
- California (25%)
- New Hampshire (24.5%)
- Wyoming (24.2%)
- Montana (23.7%)

Lowest:

- North Dakota (9.3%)
- South Dakota (10.2%)
- Mississippi (11.5%)
- Alabama (12.3%)
- Tennessee (13.5%)
- Maine (14.5%)
- Texas (15.4%)
- North Carolina (15.4%)
- Louisiana (15.5%)

Some statistics using those numbers:

- Rate of religiousness and murder rates are inversely correlated; the highest rates are found in Louisiana and Alabama while the lowest are in Vermont and Oregon.
- The poverty rate is similarly related to the proportion of atheists, with the most poor people in Mississippi and Tennessee, while the fewest in poverty are found in New Hampshire and Hawaii.
- Mississippi has the highest obesity rate at 31.6%, followed by West Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, and South Carolina; the lowest rates are in Colorado (18.4%), Hawaii, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont.
- Infant mortality and teen pregnancy show similar trends; STD rates are highest in the Bible Belt where college graduation rates are also the lowest.

## Where I Stand

I'm on the side of the statistics, which show stronger societies are those with less religion.

BODY:
Perl signal handling is easy.  Simply create a subroutine to handle a signal and register it as handler in the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html#%25SIG">%SIG</a> hash:

<pre class="brush: perl">
#!/usr/bin/env perl
$SIG{'INT'} = \&sigIntHandler;

sleep 100;

sub sigIntHandler {
    print "INT caught!\n";
    exit;
}
</pre>

While this is better than nothing, its fairly limited.  Your program is yanked out of its scope, making it difficult to clean up.  Without any state information, how are you supposed to know what to do when you get the signal?  The easiest thing to do is note that you have received a signal in the handler, then check and deal with that fact within any parts of your program that need to do things when signals occur.

<pre class="brush: perl">
#!/usr/bin/env perl
$SIG{'INT'} = \&sigIntHandler;

# Flags for signals that have been caught
my %caught;

while (1) {
    print "Sleeping 5\n";
    sleep 5;
    print "More sleeping\n";
    sleep 5;

    # If we got SIGINT (2), exit
    exit if ($caught{'INT'} == 1);
}

# When we get a signal, set a flag in %caught
sub sigIntHandler {
    print "INT caught!\n";
    $caught{'INT'} = 1;
}
</pre>

In this setup, all the signal handler does it set a flag in the <a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/blog/630">package global</a> <tt>%caught</tt> that the program received a signal.  The main loop checks each time through to see if a signal has been issued and does what is appropriate; in this case, simply exiting.  Play around with this simple program and notice that when the signal happens, the statement that was being executed is interrupted and Perl starts back up with the next statement once the signal handler returns.


In a real-world example makes things much clearer, demonstrating how you can actually use signals for program management.  At <a href="http://eng.genius.com">Genius.com</a> we have a daemon that starts worker children to perform tasks.  The main loop for each of these children looks something like this:

<pre class="brush: perl">
# Worker class for daemon
package ExampleDaemon::Worker;
use Moose;

# Declare the global
our $SIG_CAUGHT = 0;

# Explicit constructor in Moose
sub BUILD {
    $SIG{'INT'} = \&sigHandler;
    $SIG{'TERM'} = \&sigHandler;
}

# Main loop
sub doWork {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $widgetsMade = 0;

    while (1) {
        # Make a widget

        # Check for signals each time through
        last if $SIG_CAUGHT
    }

    return $widgetsMade;
}

sub sigHandler {
    my ($sigName) = @_;

    $SIG_CAUGHT = 1;

    return 1;
}
</pre>

Under normal circumstances the parent creates a child and invokes the <tt>doWork()</tt> subroutine.  This subroutine does some work and returns the number of widgets it created.  If the child receives a signal while building widgets, the handler logs and sets a flag.  The main loop checks for this and halts work, returning if a signal has been caught.  Why, you may ask, would a child receive a signal?  Surely <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/odds/bofh/">no one</a> will go around kill(1)ing children, right?  I think it's a reasonable assumption.  The real thing I made child signal handlers for is allowing the parent to relay signals, cleanly shutting down the daemon.

<pre class="brush: perl">
# Main class for daemon
package ExampleDaemon::Main;
use Moose;

# Package global so that the signal handlers have access
our @children;

# Explicit constructor in Moose
sub BUILD {
    $SIG{'INT'} = \&cleanupAndShutdown;
    $SIG{'TERM'} = \&cleanupAndShutdown;
    $SIG{'HUP'} = \&restartChildren;
}

sub run {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $pfm = Parallel::ForkManager->new($self->numChildren);
    while (1) {
        my $pid = $pfm->start;

        if ($pid != 0) {
            # Parent process
            push @children, $pid;

            # Start children judiciously
            sleep 1;
            next;
        }

        # Child process; do some work
        $self->startWorker();

        # Worker finished, clean up the $pfm instance
        $pfm->finish();
    }

    # Parent waits here for children to run
    $pfm->wait_all_children();

    return $widgetsMade;
}

sub startWorker {
    my ($self) = @_;
 
    my $worker = ExampleDaemon::Worker->new();
    return $worker->doWork();
}

# Send TERM to children when we get INT or TERM
sub cleanupAndShutdown {
    my ($sigName) = @_;

    kill 15, @children;

    exit;    
}

# Kill the children, which will respawn, and re-read the logging config file
sub restartChildren {
    my ($sigName) = @_;

    kill 15, @children;
    @children = [];

    my $loggingConfigFile = '/etc/daemonLogging.conf';
    Log::Log4perl->init($loggingConfigFile);

    return 1;
}
</pre>

The parent process utilizes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Parallel::ForkManager">Parallel::ForkManager</a> to spin off children.  We store the PIDs of these children in a package global, <tt>@children</tt>, because the signal handler gets no state information (i.e. it isn't given <tt>$self</tt>), so it can only access things that are global to the package.  As before, we register signal handlers, which do whatever is required.  In the case of <tt>cleanupAndShutdown()</tt> (which handles INT and TERM), we kill all of the children and then <tt>exit</tt> in the parent process.  If the parent process receives a HUP instead, we kill the children and then simply <tt>return</tt> from the signal handler, which returns to the main loop of the parent which will respawn the children.

in your final example, you call $self->startWorker().  But you don't show how you relate this daemon to the worker class (like the one above).  Was this an omission or does some magic happen by convention that the daemon knows about the worker class or script file?
Thanks!

Merely an oversight on my part—startWorker() is a method in the main daemon class that creates a worker class instance and makes with the go.  I've updated the example, thanks for catching that!

BODY:
This past weekend, [Team BVD Skidmark](http://twitter.com/bvdskidmark) participated in its first 24 Hours of LeMons, the 2010 [Goin' For Broken](http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/reno10/) at [Thunderhill Raceway](http://www.trackpedia.com/wiki/Thunderhill_Park_Raceway) outside Willows, CA.  The team consisted of myself, two folks from [Genius.com](http://genius.com), and three guys that were part of [CSH](http://www.csh.rit.edu).  In the end, only 5 of us drove the car at the race, because one of our team was quite sick in the lead up to the race.

Getting There
===========
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4585093337/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4585093337_820fe9ec11.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
We loaded up Cheesy Gordita Crunch, named after a shopping list found in the glove box, on Thursday night before the race, along with all of our tools in the van.  Matt & his wife Lynn drove the van, Bill, Tristan, Quynh, and I were in the RV that we had rented, along with a weekend's worth of food from Costco.  The drive up to WIllows is pretty boring, and not much fun when you're driving an RV and a van with a trailer.  All was going well until about 10 that night when one of the inside rear tires on the RV [de-laminated](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4586161585/) with a loud thud, followed by a thumping from the flail that was left on the tire.  The latter sound was reminiscent of the sound that Cheesy's original tires made when we bought the car.

Luckily, we were only a mile from a gas station, and only a few miles from Willows itself.  We pulled into the gas station for the night, parking behind it.  At 6 the next morning, I got up and called the RV rental roadside assistance line; they said that a tow truck could be there to swap the wheel within an hour.  We sent the van & car ahead to claim a good pit spot while the rest of us waited for the RV to get fixed.  The wheel replacement didn't take long and the team was reunited in the paddock by 8 AM.  We unloaded the tools, pulled the car off the trailer, and signed up for the Friday practice session ($200 + $50 per driver).

Friday
=====
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4597256843/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4597256843_ccbb7f1520.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
The pre-race practice session was supremely useful—all of our drivers got a chance to hot lap on the track and get a feel for the car that hadn't been driven since we brought it across The Bay months before.  Everything felt good and Cheesy did great all of Friday.  I had been on the fence about doing the track day because I thought we might be using up what little life the car had.  Getting out on Friday turned out to be a perfectly good thing, however, because it bolstered everyone's confidence in their own abilities, and our confidence in the car.

We did tech inspection with a few issues: tape the rear lights, tape the positive battery breakout in the engine compartment, and wire the clips for the harness.  Bullshit inspection was pretty easy for us, given that we had a bone stock car and are pretty clueless.  Having an [e30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_%28E30%29) brings immediate scorn from the judges, but the fact that ours is the efficiency model and has an automatic helps.  The Starbucks cards that Matt bribed the judges with helped, too; it also didn't hurt that our engine's intake is green from moss that was growing on it.  In the end, they only gave us 5 penalty laps, mostly for having a crappy theme—really, we just had a car seat bolted to the roof and some huge Firefox stickers on the car.

At the end of the day, we swapped tires from the hard as anything, 55 series on 14" e30 wheels to the set of fairly low-profile tires on 16" wheels that had come with Cheesy.  We cooked some burgers and headed out for a track walk at the end of the day.

Saturday
=======
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4597885916/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3361/4597885916_fd5c7d86a9.jpg" width="379" height="500" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
I got up at 6:30, grabbed a shower (luxurious Thunderhill!) and roused the team.  I made some eggs, we gave the car a quick check, and headed off to the driver's meeting at 8.  The meeting was as expected—a rundown on flags, an admonition to not drive crappily, and some quick words about logistics for the day.  With that, we headed back to the paddock and I suited up for the first stint.

I got out just before 9 and circulated a couple of laps with the handful of cars out there, until the green flag dropped.  On the third lap, I managed to [spin in turn 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XCAIb8AP0U).  I could blame the different tires on the car, but that really just adds to the fact that should have been taking things more slowly 3 laps in at the beginning of my stint.  I had gotten overzealous.  We were penalized to re-theme the car, and we quickly applied spray paint to implement the original "skidmark" theme that we had originally thrown around months ago.  I headed back out for a little more driving, and set the fast lap for the team that stood for the day.

After my stint, Tristan went out and spun in 11.  Back into the penalty box, we made an abbreviated walk of shame thanks to the Judgemobile's music dying.  Bill took Tristan's place and was out for a while before also spinning in 11.  We saw the judges again and were ordered to get the very first Cone of Shame in the race.  Since they were pretty unimpressed with a team getting 3 black flags before Noon, we found the biggest cone in the entire paddock, and returned to attach it to our car.  With a tow strap and some zip ties, we had the cone on and the car was back out there.  Matt did a stint and then Josh got in the car.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4591665777/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4591665777_26b946ea7b.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
Josh came in after about half an hour, and one of the cooking thermometers was wailing: it had hit the target temperature of 200 degrees fahrenheit.  The roast wasn't done—the engine was hot.  He shut it down and upon opening the hood and the missing water pump belt was pretty obvious.  As the chief mechanic, I proceeded to bark some orders to the team and jumped under the car to fix the problem.  After a brief struggle getting the forward-opening hood off, and dealing with the alternator with a broken belt-tensioning belt, the engine was back the way it should be.  With the hood reattached, I went out for a stint.

We had a bunch more uneventful, but terribly fun driving the rest of Saturday and that evening, talked with a bunch of the other competitors.  We ended up selling our extra rear brake pads to the Ninja team (all black e30 with a HUGE sprint car wing) and got tons of advice out of the trade.  We talked with a bunch of judges and learned about the [Bob Ross](http://jalopnik.com/5165999/the-penalties-of-the-gator+o+rama-24-hours-of-lemons) penalty that they applied to any car with a good expanse of paintable sheet metal.

Sunday
======
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4597929298/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/4597929298_c58a8f3f6e.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
The second day of the race started with unintended excitement.  Matt started the car just before the driver's meeting and it spewed automatic transmission fluid—the adapters of our hacked-in ATF cooler had failed.  Thankfully, we had thought ahead a bit and left all of the stock hookups unmolested.  With some quick Vice-grip work, we managed to hook the ATF lines back up to the stock cooler and get out onto the track from the beginning of the day.  Josh & Matt did morning stints and then I headed out.  At Matt's suggestion, I started shifting the car, rather than just leaving it in drive the whole time; this lead to a [new fast lap for the team of 2:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziyXtDNlr0E).  Much better than Saturday's 2:46, but a far cry from the leaders who were running [better than 2:20](http://forums.24hoursoflemons.com/viewtopic.php?pid=46151#p46151).  Even though we weren't super fast, the added power out of turns allowed us to [pass a number of other cars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNdPKLJOjU8).

At the end of the day, we were in 65th place out of 108 runners—pretty damn good for a completely new team with a stock, automatic racecar.  After this experience, the entire team is pumped to do more LeMons races.  While track days and HPDEs are awesome, those can't hold a candle to wheel to wheel racing, especially when you're in a car that is cheap and you're OK with driving like you stole it.

24 Hours of LeMons: highly recommended.

Goin' for Broken was the first [24 Hours of LeMons](http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/) event for Team BVD Skidmark.  None of us had ever done LeMons before, and only a few of my teammates had even been on a racetrack previously.

In The Beginning
=============

This all started when Matt asked if I had heard of this 24 Hours of LeMons thing...in fact, I had.  I was on the verge of starting a team for the first East Coast races before I moved out to California.  In short, we rounded up some other folks and submitted an application for [Goin' For Broken 2010](http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/reno10/) at Thunderhill in May.

Just as the website says, we got our confirmation for the race 10 weeks out in Early March.  To start, I called a meeting of the prospective team members to get together and pay the entry fee, which was $1,500 for our 6 driver team.  I had also drawn up a very rudimentary budget by talking to a friend of a friend, and running some quick numbers--it worked out to about $1,000-1,500 per driver, all said and done.

Since we had a committed team, the next move was to find a $500 car.  Since submitting the application for the race, a few of us had been trolling Craigslist to get an idea of what was out there.  The week after we were accepted, a BMW 325es showed up, which seemed like a very good option to me.  I have been a part of the BMW community for a number of years, and do all of my own work on my e36 M3.

We've Got a Car
=============

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/4529690546/"><img alt="Cheesy Gordita Crunch" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4529690546_aebf6e4f62.jpg

Once we had a car, the first order of business was to get a roll cage installed.  I looked up a few race shops in the Bay Area and stumbled across [Evil Genius Racing](http://www.evilgeniusracing.com/).  Of the places I called, they were by far the most helpful, and even had the cheapest offering; turns out, John is very involved in the 24 Hours of LeMons, so we couldn't have found a better shop.

Before getting the cage installed, we had to clean out the car.  We spent a couple of Saturdays with 3 or 4 guys just removing the car's interior--everything from the car's interior.  When we were done, the only thing left was the un-bolted driver's seat, the windshield, and the back window.  John had advised that we even remove the dashboard, so that they could install a dash bar, resulting in a safer cage.

The only other work we did at that stage was fixing the brakes.  When we got our car, the brake pedal went to the floor. Having never worked on crappy cars, I wasn't sure what the problem was, but figured it to probably be the master cylinder.  We tried swapping the completely worn out pads, and the gouged rotors to no avail.  It was indeed the master cylinder.  A trip to [Pick-n-Pull](http://www.picknpull.com) and we had a replacement, solving our brake issues.

Finally, we trailered the car to Sacremento, and left it with Evil Genius.  The next weekend, we sent a team to pick up the car, complete with roll cage.  It was starting to look like a real race car now.

Racecar Preparation
================

Aside from the roll cage, the 24 Hours of LeMons rules mandate a bunch of other safety gear.  Bill found a race seat of the type recommended by John at Evil Genius Racing, a [Kirkey Intermediate Road Race Seat](http://www.ioportracing.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=K47&Category_Code=KRS1) on Craigslist.  After a test fit it was abundantly clear that the seat was much to low to actually drive.  We made some calls and, once again, John at Evil Genius came to the rescue, suggesting we use some 2 inch square tubing to get the seat higher.  We ordered some 2 foot long pieces on the internet along with some grade 8 bolts to mount it.  After a bunch of drilling and test fitting, the seat ended up fitting atop its brackets with the square tubing underneath.

Other things included mounting the fire extinguisher to the transmission tunnel (in reach of the driver) and mounting the center brake light, since we had removed it's stock mount along with the rear deck.  Other things to comply with the rules included painting numbers on the doors & hood, securing the battery, painting tow locations, and installing the kill switch--that last one being a bit difficult.  Our BMW, like most, is equipped with a rear mounted battery, which gets power to the front of the car through a single, huge cable running along the passenger side.  The cable itself took 20 minutes to cut through, but with it severed, Ryan was able to get the kill switch itself wired up in another hour of work.  We used a single-pole double-throw switch, running some 2-gauge cable from the original battery cable over to the left of the steering wheel, making it accessible by both the driver and anyone outside the car.  The second throw was used to interrupt the positive line heading to the ignition coil, which we did with some 8-gauge speaker wire.

To The Races
===========

After all of this work, the car was ready to go and we [headed to the track](http://dinomite.net/2010/bvd-skidmarks-first-24-hours-of-lemons/).  At the track, we rigged up a few things, including some [probe thermometers](http://www.amazon.com/Polder-Original-Cooking-Timer-Thermometer/dp/B0000CF5MT/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1273725647&sr=8-6) for monitoring the water & transmission temperatures.  It turns out, these hack gauges were the best thing in the world--they feature temperature alarms that make sure you know when something has gone wrong.  Without a doubt, having the alarm go off after our water pump belt broke kept us in the race.

If you have ever thought about doing the 24 Hours of LeMons or had the desire to race at all, get a team together and do it.  It's a bit of work, but entirely doable and an incredible amount of fun.

BODY:
The leaking [MC252](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macondo_Prospect) oil well is releasing an incredible amount of hydrocarbons—estimates have moved upwards from BP's ludicrously low 5,000 barrels per day all the way up to 100,000 bbl/day.  Beyond environmental effects of this released material, the amount of potential energy held in the hydrocarbons that are going uncaptured is staggering.

# Flaring
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bpamerica/4690897909/in/photostream/"><img alt="Development II driller with the Discoverer Enterprise flaring gas in the background" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1284/4690897909_e01961c193.jpg" width="400" height="446" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
Since getting the [lower marine riser package (LMRP) cap](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/6560) installed last month, the Deepwater Horizon response team has been able to capture a portion of the oil & gas leaking from the well.  Hydrocarbons are brought to the surface aboard the [drillship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drillship) [Discoverer Enterprise](http://www.ship-technology.com/projects/discoverer/) which transfers the oil to tankers that in turn shuttle it to shore. Unfortunately, the Discoverer Enterprise isn't equipped to handle natural gas, and can only capture a limited amount of oil.  For the first twelve days that the LMRP cap was installed, June 3rd through June 15th, the Discoverer Enterprise collected as much oil as it could each day, up to a maximum of 15,000 barrels per day.  The LMRP cap was configured to only capture as much oil as the maximum amount that the Discoverer Enterprise could recover, with the excess allowed to flow around the LMRP cap and into the ocean directly.  Natural gas that came to the surface was immediately flared by the drillship, which lacks any other ability to handle gas.

On June 16th, the [Helix Q4000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q4000) joined the Discoverer Enterprise on the scene as a secondary vessel to handle the well's producation.  While the Q4000 adds no oil capturing capacity, it does have the capability to flare oil, allowing the LMRP cap to be reconfigured, bringing more oil & gas to the surface.  BP has been releasing [daily statistics](http://www.bp.com/extendedsectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=40&contentId=7061813) concerning the amount of oil & gas flared, allowing us to calculate the energy that is unceremoniously disposed of each day.

Since the Q4000 arrived, an average of 8,400 barrels of oil and 1.49 million cubic meters of natural gas have been flared.  A barrel of crude oil contains 6,119 megajoules of energy and a cubic meter of natural gas 40.9 megajoules.  Using these numbers together tells us that **51.48 terajoules** of oil energy is burned in the form of oil and **60.97 TJ** from flared natural gas every day.

The total energy being continuously burned each second from the MC252 leak is **1.3 gigawatts**, the same amount of energy as produced by a large nuclear power reactor or nearly 3 times the [average power generated by the Hoover Dam](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html).

# Other energy loss
The above calculations only concern the amount of oil and gas collected by the installed LMRP cap, and not the other balance of the well's production that is released into the ocean without being captured.  This additional flow amounts to 35,000–60,000 bbl/day according to the [most recent estimate](http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com/go/doc/2931/661583/) of the Flow Rate Technical Group.  In terms of energy, this amounts to 2.5–4.2 gigawatts of potential energy lost to the ocean.

BODY:
The most powerful part of Unix/Linux/BSD is the command line.  In stock trim, the Unix shells are all very effective, but your time can be more effective by customizing the shell.  I use `bash`, so I know that these things work in that shell, but they ought to be easily transferred to others as well.

## Aliases

A good friend of mine, [Jordan Sissel](http://semicomplete.com), once said that if you do something more than once, you're doing it wrong.  His conjecture applies as much to your shell as it does to your [browser](http://dinomite.net/2008/smart-bookmarks)—computers are great at repetitive tasks, so you shouldn't bore yourself with such things.  Therein lies the most important thing you can do with your shell: make common tasks easier with aliases.

First things first, I use `ls` a whole lot, and, despite it's simple makeup, I often mistype the command.  I don't care about being able to easily run [Steam Locomotive](http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/games/sl.html), and there's no `s` or `l` command, so I replace those all with `ls`:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">alias sl="ls"
alias l="ls"
alias s="ls"
alias ll="ls -l"
alias lh="ls -lh"
alias la="ls -la"</pre>
Another thing I do all the time is descend into directories, which means I need to get out of them, too:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias ..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../.."
alias ....="cd ../../.."
alias .....="cd ../../../.."
alias ......="cd ../../../../.."
alias .......="cd ../../../../../.."
</pre>

I always want extended regular expressions, and there are tons of things I don't want to search when I grep (though I use <a href="http://betterthangrep.com">ack</a> these days):

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias grep="egrep"
alias G="grep -n --color=always --binary-file=without-match --exclude=tags \
--exclude=*-min.js --exclude-dir='.[a-zA-Z]*' --exclude-dir='external' \
--exclude-dir='blib'"
</pre>

Furthermore, I often want to do recursive greps of a entire codebase, sometimes case insensitive, and like everything else, I mistype it:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias GR="G -r"
alias RG="GR"
alias GRI="G -r -i"
alias GIR="GRI"
alias IGR="GRI"
alias IRG="GRI"
</pre>

If you do any sort of system administration, you need to grep the process list; make that easy:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias paux="ps aux|grep -i"
</pre>

Is someone shoulder surfing?
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias c="clear"
alias logout="clear; logout"
</pre>

[Matt Behrens](http://asktherelic.com) tipped me off to this one—`type -a` tells you a lot more than the standard `which`:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias which='type -a'
</pre>

When I'm writing in a language that requires compilation, I use cowsay to break up the output of each run, so that errors are easy to distinguish between this run and the previous one:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias gcc='cowsay "Hello"; gcc'
alias g++='cowsay "Hello"; g++'
alias make='cowsay "Hello"; nice -n 10 make'
alias javac='cowsay "Hello"; javac'
</pre>

Machines that I SSH to often get their names as aliases; I've got a bunch more of these:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
alias claudius="ssh -Y dinomite@dinomite.net"
alias caligula="ssh -Y dinomite@caligula.dinomite.net"
</pre>

## Prompt

There are numerous articles about pimping out your shell's prompt, many include previous command exit codes, the time, the current energy of the LHC, and the price of the S&P 500.  I have a web browser, so I don't need all that information—I only put in my prompt things that are pertinent to the task at hand.  The things that make up my prompt are a bit complicated, so I build it in stages.  First, since I work on a lot of different machines, I always have the hostname in my prompt.  To make it easy to tell which machine I'm on, I assign colors to the systems that I use most often:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
HOSTNAME=`hostname|sed -e 's/\..*$//'`
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'Caligula' ] || [ $HOSTNAME = 'Caligula.local' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;35m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'claudius' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;36m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'dev1' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;34m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'svr-dev-rw1' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;31m\]"
fi
if [ $HOSTNAME = 'drewfus' ]; then
    export HOST_COLOR="\[\033[1;30m\]"
fi
</pre>

Next, I capitalize the hostname and make the colon separating it from the path red if I'm currently acting as root via `sudo -s`.  This makes it very hard to forget that the consequences of actions are great at the current time:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
COLON_COLOR='0m'
if [ ${UID} -eq 0 ]; then
    COLON_COLOR='1;31m'
fi
if [ ${UID} -eq 0 ]; then
    HOSTNAME="`echo $HOSTNAME|tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'`"
fi
</pre>

Finally, build the actual prompt:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
PS1=`echo -ne "$HOST_COLOR$HOSTNAME\[\033[00m\]\[\e[$COLON_COLOR\]:\[\033[33m\]\
w\[\033[00m\]\\[\033[01;33m\]\$\[\033[00m\] "`
</pre>

What does this look like?<br>
<span style="color: #00ccff;">claudius</span>:<span style="color: #339966;">/usr/local$</span><br>
And when root:<br>
<span style="color: #00ccff;">CLAUDIUS</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #339966;">/usr/local$</span>

## History

There are a lot of complicated commands that I only use occasionally; having a big history means if I've used it once, I can easily search and find the command later.  The `histappend` options tells bash to append rather than overwrite the history file and `cmdhist` combines multi-line history commands into a single entry.  It's often useful to run the same command repeatedly, and I find myself typing `ls` whenever I stop to think; setting `HISTCONTROL` and `HISTIGNORE` keeps those actions from filling up my history.

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
#"I know I've used that command before, but I can't remember the syntax"
export HISTSIZE=50000
shopt -s histappend
shopt -s cmdhist
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
export HISTIGNORE="&:ls:ll:la:lh:sl"
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S - '
</pre>

## Environment Variables

A lot of linuxes come with lackluster program defaults (emacs, more, etc.); you can get better ones by setting environment variables:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
export PAGER=/usr/bin/less
export EDITOR='vim -X'
export BROWSER='firefox'
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
</pre>

Since we are in the 21st century, I use Unicode:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"
</pre>

## Functions

I use Perl a lot, and have to deal with keeping modules the same across different systems; this function makes getting the installed version of a module easy:

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function perlmodver {
    perl -M$1 -e 'print "Version " . $ARGV[0]->VERSION . " of " . $ARGV[0] . " is installed.\n"' $1
}
</pre>

The thing I use `awk` for most often is '{print $n}', so I wrote [`fawk`](http://dinomite.net/2009/fawk/) which you give a number and it des just that:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function fawk {
    first="awk '{print "
    last="}'"
    cmd="${first}\$${1}${last}"
    eval $cmd
}
</pre>

`awk` also does math:
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
function calc {
    awk "BEGIN{ print $* }";
}
</pre>

## Tying It All Together

To keep things organized, I separate the above mentioned things into a few different files, so my `.bashrc` brings them all together.  Additionally, I check for a `.bash_local` file, which isn't <a href="http://dinomite.net/2008/keeping-your-home-directory-in-subversion/">checked into subversion</a>, so that I can have machine-specific alterations to my shell environment.

<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: false">
# .bashrc
source ~/.bash_global
source ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_functions
if [ -f ~/.bash_local ]
then
    source ~/.bash_local
fi
</pre>

<p>Another thing I find useful is to set my path in a separate file. I use ZSH and I have a .zshpath file which I source in my .zshrc. In my last job I found a complex set of legacy tools that had a ton of random paths. Having a path file with a single path per line made it really easy to work through my path and change it when needed.</p>

BODY:
My Internet Birthday recently passed.  What is an Internet Birthday, you ask?  Why it's the arbitrary date that I've chosen to give when a website wants to know my birthday.  You see, gentle reader, the vast majority of websites that ask for your birthday have no real reason to have it; most of the time it will simply be used for marketing.  Whether or not you really care about that relatively innocuous usage, the real danger is that a lot of legitimate, organizations such as financial institutions, hospitals, and governments, use your birthday as an identifying piece of information—as though providing such a date is a verification of the person speaking or filling out a form.

Because of this abuse of a fairly public piece of information for the purpose of security, it is reasonable to want to keep your date of birth somewhat secret—or at least refrain from giving it to everyone who asks.  Unfortunately, many services require you to provide a date of birth when signing up; some will give you a bonus if you give them your birthday.  So as to not miss out on these services, I simply came up with a date that I use as my birthday when asked on the internet.  I no longer hesitate to provide the information asked.  Why not use a random date every time you sign up?  Sometimes, particularly if you forget your password, a website will want you to enter your birthday at a later time to verify who you are.  By choosing one date and sticking to it, you can always give the correct information.
<h2>Choosing an Internet Birthday</h2>
To come up with an internet birthday, simply choose a date!  Afraid you won't remember?  Understandable.  Choose something that makes sense to you: the first or last day of the month you were born, the day you were born modulo 12 to get a new month, or take <a href="http://cheshirecatalyst.com/birthday.html">Cheshire Catalyst's suggestion</a> and use the start or end date for your astrological symbol.  As for the year, in most cases keeping the same year as your actual birth is the easiest and effective enough for our purpose.  If you're really paranoid, then just round to the nearest half-decade
<h2>Internet Family</h2>
Cheshire has updated his essay to suggest that an internet "Mother's Maiden Name" is also beneficial—and I agree.  I have an entire family based upon characters from a movie that I use for my financial accounts.  If you're serious about security, or you just can't remember the surnames names of your recent ancestors, then an Internet family based upon your favorite (or not so favorite) story is a great route to take.

I have finally completed my Zombie Defense Station.  Inspired by <a title="Craftster Zombie Defense Station" href="http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=202668.0">this post</a> that made it around the internet a few months ago, my kit contains a <a title="Sig P226 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_P226">Sig P226</a> handgun, a <a title="Franchi SPAS-12 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchi_SPAS-12">Franchi SPAS-12</a> shotgun (as seen in  <a title="Jurrasic Park on IMFDB" href="http://www.imfdb.org/index.php?title=Jurassic_Park#Franchi_SPAS-12">Jurassic Park</a>), and a<a title="Gerber Gator Machete" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gerber-22-41576-Gator-Machete-Sheath/dp/B000Q9BBZI"> Gerber Gator</a> machete, which looks unnecessarily evil.

The construction was pretty easy and consists of the following parts
<ul>
	<li>1/4 inch beech plywood</li>
	<li>1x4 pine plank</li>
	<li>1/2 inch pine square</li>
	<li>1/2 inch dowel</li>
	<li>3/16 inch thick plexiglass</li>
	<li>Stencils from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a></li>
	<li>Airsoft guns</li>
	<li>Gerber Gator machete</li>
</ul>

<a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3436/3394065314_77242815ae_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="160" /></a>

The first thing I did was get the airsoft guns and the machete, so that I could decide how big to make the enclosure.  I bought the SPAS-12 online at the suggestion of my roommate when I said that I just wanted an awesome looking shotgun.  We then trekked to various stores in the area in search of machetes.  After turning up empty handed at OSH, Home Depot, and Target we hit the jackpot in Sports Authority's camping section.  For some reason, Gerber makes, and Sports Authority carries, this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3394065314/">15 inch, saw-back machete</a>.  While I think it is absolutely unnecessary for camping purposes, the Gerber Gator is a great zombie knife.

I settled on 34 inches long and 15 inches high, since that fit the SPAS-12 nicely with room for the machete underneath.  I cut the box perimeter, screwed it square, and then screwed the back of the box to that.  I affixed some 3.5 inch long pieces of 1/2 inch pine square to the corners, upon which the plexiglass would later rest.  To mount the guns, I used some 2 and 3 inch long pieces of 1/2 in dowel that are screwed in place from the back of the box.  The machete is held in place by some small metal hooks that I got in the Home Depot hardware aisle.

<a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3406616916/in/set-72157616252174270/"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3406616916_4a23319e58_m.jpg" alt="15 inch machete saw" width="240" height="116" /></a>

After the box was all assembled, I tossed a coat of gray paint on the inside, and bright red around the perimeter.  I cut a piece of 3/16 plexiglass with a razor knife (doesn't work very well - is there a better way?) and stenciled it using the stick-on stencils I orderd from <a href="http://www.stencilease.com/">StencilEase</a>.  To put the plexiglass into place, I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/3M-Scotch-Removable-Mounting-Squares/dp/B001B0D46K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1240125975&amp;sr=8-3">3m Removable Mounting Squares</a>.

My house is now safe from zombie attacks.

<p>I'm beginning to read more and more posts about people upset with ebay. I have some good news for you. With the help of some national radio publicity, some people started an auction site and they are going after the people who have been wronged by ebay. It appears they are gaining ground! This site is getting national attention so hurry and get your items on there now. Their first 25,000 listings are FREE and final value fees are as much as 80% cheaper than ebay's and much easier to understand!! Also you can <strong>bring your feedback with you!</strong> Read about their Anti-Sniping feature which is very beneficial to Sellers and also buyers. They have lots of other cool features as well. Just go to w ww . JaGetit . com (take out the spaces) <a href="http://JaGetIt.com" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://JaGetIt.com" rel="nofollow">http://JaGetIt.com</a></a>

BODY:
Ubuntu's [Screen Profiles](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreenProfiles) package taught a lot of folks about how GNU Screen can be so much more than a fancy replacement for [nohup(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup).  Since GNU Screen's name is difficult enough to search for, they have thankfully renamed the package to [Byobu](https://launchpad.net/byobu).  Byobu provides users with a whole bunch of pre-defined aliases to make working within Screen easier, and make more sense by defining a useful status line.  There's more that can be done with screen, the most notable in my view is creating predefined working environments that make getting yourself up and running when logging into a system easy.

I've got a number of different things that I commonly do where I want a number of different screen windows: running the deamons on our development server, connecting to the DB servers in each of the different environments, and developing an experimental project.  For each of these applications, I have created a screenrc that I keep in my `.screen/` directory; the basic format is this:

<pre class="brush: bash;">
source $HOME/.screenrc

sessionname daemons
chdir /code/htdocs/dstephens/trunk/webroot/daemons

screen -t 'CONTROL' bash
screen -t 'aggregator' bash
screen -t 'autoEventWatcher' bash
screen -t 'emailReady' bash
screen -t 'sfUpload' bash
screen -t 'jmsCommandExecutor' bash
screen -t 'bouncedEmail' bash
select 0
</pre>

First, I source my global `.screenrc`, which includes setting a statusline, larger scrollback buffer, multiuser and utf8.  Next, giving the session a name makes it easier for me to figure out which one to reattach to later. Finally, I create and name all of the windows that I want to have in my session, in this case, one for each of the daemons that I want to be able to run.

To run a specific preset, just invoke screen with the `-c` option: `screen -c ~/.screen/daemons`.  Easy.

BODY:
When walking through Ikea one day, I spotted the perfect bottles in which to make Skittles vodka.  Starting with these, here is the process for making this infusion.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964554487/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Skittles vodka materials"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2465/3964554487_50b848e127_m.jpg" alt="Skittles vodka materials" width="240" height="122" /></a> 
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1300 grams of Skittles [$18 at Costco]</li>
	<li>4 liters of vodka [$60 at Costco]</li>
	<li>Five 1 liter bottles [$25 at Ikea]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Paper towels</li>
	<li>Colander</li>
	<li>Funnel</li>
	<li>1 liter bowl</li>
	<li>5 bowls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964553495/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Sorting Skittles"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2585/3964553495_544ab42731_m.jpg" alt="Sorting Skittles" width="240" height="158" /></a>
The first tedious part of this process is sorting the Skittles into their various colors (ostensibly, flavors).  I sat down in front of the [Singapore Grand Prix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Singapore_Grand_Prix) with six plates: one for each of the five Skittles colors and an extra on which to dump packages for sorting.  I bough a box of 36 normal-size (61 gram) packages of Skittles from Costco and ended up using 22 of the packs.  To sort them, I poured a few packages onto one of the plates and separated the candies onto the five others.

After consulting <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Shoot-the-Rainbow-Skittles-Vodka/">other</a> who had <a href="http://mixthatdrink.com/skittles-vodka-tutorial/">made Skittles vodka</a>, I settled on needing 240 Skittles per liter of vodka.

<br>
<h2>Assembly</h2>
Now comes the easy part.  To get the Skittles into my narrow-mouthed bottles, I made a simple paper funnel and carefully poured the candies in.  Easy.  Then, I just used my liquid funnel to fill each bottle with vodka.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964551461/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="The assembled Skittles vodka team"><img class="alignright" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2536/3964551461_2316f38122_m.jpg" alt="The assembled Skittles vodka team" width="240" height="172" /></a> 

<h2>Shake and Wait</h2>
After each of the containers was filled, I gave them a quick shake; within a few hours, much of the candies had dissolved.  I left them overnight, and by the next day all that was left was a small bed of white pebbles in the bottom of each bottle.

<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>Finally, the filtration.  This step is the most difficult, because it requires a lot of patience even though you're almost done!</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/3964546733/" class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Small" title="Completed Skittles vodka"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2473/3964546733_0ab8c7a1db_m.jpg" alt="Completed Skittles vodka" width="240" height="128" /></a>
<p>A lot of the mass of Skittles is binder—corn starch and the like.  It leaves a significant amount of scum onthe top of your Skittles vodka mix.  To strain it off, I started by using standard office coffee filters, but those clogged very quickly.  I switched to normal paper towels, which made filtering take about 5 minutes per bottle.  After filtering, re-bottle and enjoy your super-sweet vodka rainbow!</p>

BODY:
On October 9th, I ran the [Northern California Tough Mudder](http://toughmudder.com/events/northern-california/bear-valley-course-map/).  Billing itself as "the TOUGHEST one day event on the planet", Tough Mudder is an endurance race helad at a number of venues throughout the United States.  The event is basically a trail run punctuated by obstacles.  Except there aren't many trails involved--the terrain covered is largely rock washes and barren mountain.  <a href="http://toughmudder.com/events/">Most of the locations</a> are ski resorts, perfect because they offer challenging ground with significant elevation change to add difficulty.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryandoherty/5065905645/"><img alt="Crossing the finish line" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5065905645_acd88fec4e.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
As they say at the start line, this isn't your average trail run, mud run, obstacle course, triathlon, or marathon.  In my mind, Tough Mudder is one of many things that could be considered what <a href="http://www.crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> is all about.  The Norcal event took place at <a href="http://www.bearvalley.com">Bear Valley Mountain Resort</a>, which ranges in elevation from about 7,000 feet up to 8,500 feet.  The start of the run was near the bottom, leaving us to go up and down the entirety of that 1,500 vertical feet twice.  In the midst of that, obstacles ranged from crawling under low wire or through tubes, to being assaulted with freezing cold water from snow machines.

Overall, I'd say the hardest parts of Tough Mudder were the elevation and the running in total.  Having not done the event before, it's hard to know what it will be like.  My expectations were for a demanding obstacle course with some significant running in between.  As mentioned above, I would now describe it in the opposite order: a very difficult trail run with some obstacles along the way.

The preparation advice on the Tough Mudder site can be a bit hard to parse and leaves a lot of questions, so here's my stab at it:

 - Do CrossFit or join an elite military unit; little else that can adequately prepare you for such a demanding event
 - This is not a marathon; being a running twig won't get you through Tough Mudder in a reasonable time
 - <a href="http://www.mechanix.com/automotive/the-original-glove">Mechanix Gloves</a> which are fairly light, durable, and form fitting are a very good choice
 - Wear normal workout or outdoor clothes--you'll get dirty, but not ripped up
 - If you have an older pair of sunglasses, wear them
 - Don't worry about carrying water, it will be provided on the course every few miles
 - Walk on the right, run on the left: slowing down is fine, but please stay out of the way of the more dedicated folks
 - The water will be cold, nothing can change that

So how did I do?  Well, Tough Mudder makes a big point of saying, "it's an event, not a race".  I started in the 12:00 group, which gave me a chance to watch the first group, which started at 10:00 and included the most elite runners, begin to finish at 11:16.  I went into my group knowing that 1 hour 16 minutes was the time to beat.  I crossed the finish line at 13:43, putting me at 1 hour 43 minutes.  I discout this a bit because I spent 5 minutes or so waiting to do the spool-jumping obstacle, and nearly 15 minutes waiting at the mud-run obstacle because the pommel horse jumping was backed up.  I'm confident in saying that my correct time was about 1:25.

Like many folks, I have a desktop that I use for most of my computing, and a laptop that I use while travelling, at a coffee shop, or perhaps while <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2745228,ihnatko-multitasking-twitter-internet-092510.article">watching tv</a>.  The other thing I have is a lot of music, all nicely rated and organized in iTunes. The problem is that new music I get goes onto my desktop, but I would like to have the exact same stuff on my laptop.  Enter <a href="http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync">iTunes-Sync</a>, a simple script that I wrote to synchronize the iTunes library file and all of the content (music, etc.) that it depends upon between the two machines.  

Using iTunes-Sync is simple:

<pre lang="bash">
laptop:~/$ perl itunes_sync.pl dinomite 192.168.1.100
</pre>

That's all there is to it.  The script copies the `iTunes Library` file wholesale, and uses `rsync(1)` to pull over the album art, mobile applications, and music directories.

I only care about getting everything from my desktop to the laptop--if you want to go both ways, or perhaps preserve metadata changes made on the laptop the process will be a bit more involved.  Before you use your laptop, close iTunes on both machines, and then run iTunes-Sync from the laptop.  Go out and have fun.  When you get back, close iTunes on both machines and run iTunes-Sync from the desktop.

You can get iTunes-Sync on [GitHub](http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync); the only thing you need is the [itunes_sync.pl](http://github.com/dinomite/iTunes-Sync/raw/master/itunes_sync.pl) file itself.

That's a very useful script. Thanks for sharing! I currently use Dropbox to sync documents between my Windows desktop and laptop and my Ubuntu virtual machines. But I can appreciate that if you have a large music library you want to keep available at all your machines, you might not want to store it in a cloud service.

BODY:
I've been doing autocross and track days with my 1997 BMW M3 for long
enough that I can offer some insight into the brake pads available for
E36 M cars.  What follows are the brake pads that I have driven, in
order of heat handling. If you only drive on the street, the top of
the list is where you want to be. If you have a race car, the bottom
is your domain.

EBC Greenstuff
-----------------
An awesome street pad, thanks to producing much less dust than stock.  I drove these pads at my very first HPDE with the [National Capital Chapter](http://www.nccbmwcca.org) of the [BMW CCA](http://bmwcca.org); the track is not their forte. By the end of the second day, I had burned through 3/4 of the pads, and the car was putting out clouds of smoke braking into turn 1 on Summit Point's main circuit. Unsurprisingly, this was accompanied by significant fade.

Like stock pads, these will work for your first track experience if you are conservative, but I wouldn't recommend it. Thanks to their low dust, EBC Green Stuff work great for street pads and even the
occasional autocross.

Hawk High Performance Street (HPS)
--------
The HPS are biled as a stock-replacement pad and I would agree with that.  They dust a bit less than BMW OEM pads, and provide a little bit more fade resistance.  For track use, the HPS is much like stock or the EBC Greenstuff mentioned above--they'll work if you're new & conservative or slow.

Axxis Ultimate (ULT)
----------
These are quite similar to the HPS--less dust than stock, good feel even when stone cold, and a bit more heat handling capability than stock.  They work great for street driving and autocrossing, but are only good for limited (read: slower) track use.

Hawk High Performance Plus (HP+)
---------
The HP+ are a good compromise between track and street pads.  I recently used them for a fade-free weekend at Thunderhill with ambient temperature of 70-80F.  Unlike a full-on track pad that is downright scary on the street, the HP+ is decidedly OK on the street.  The first stop of a drive (or after not using them on the highway for a few minutes) will be a bit longer than stock pads, but not the Flintstones feeling of track pads.

Hawk Blue
---------
I am lazy, so I put my pads on at home before driving to the track, so I got to experience these on the street.  To begin with, the first stop from neighborhood speeds takes about twice the distance you expect, and the initial bit is nonexistent.  After a couple more low speed stops, the brakes have enough heat to work just fine, but they still squeal as though you are murdering cats with each brake application.

On the track, the Hawk Blue is an awesome pad.  Being a true track pad it takes some heat before they really work, as described above.  Just like you need to get your tires and brain up to temperature, with a track pad you need some heat in the brakes before they will do what you expect.  You should be driving judiciously on your out lap anyway, so this ought not be a problem.  The wear on these is much better than any of the aforementioned pads--a day at Laguna Seca burned less than one quarter.  If you have been going to the track for a while, or if you've gotten fast enough to begin feeling fade in your existing brake setup, get some track pads.

BODY:
 I have long used an [SSH tunnel](http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/12/08/ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-forwarding-secure-browsing/) (put simply: `ssh -D 8000 server` + [FoxyProxy](http://getfoxyproxy.org/)) to browse the web [securely](http://codebutler.com/firesheep) from unencrypted wireless access points and other [potentially hostile networks](http://www.wallofsheep.com/).  While this is secure, it isn't all that convenient and [has inherent problems](http://sites.inka.de/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html).  What I really want is a proper VPN, that will seamlessly encapsulate **all** traffic from my local machine and pass it through the tunnel to be emitted by the server.  [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/) is one of [those things](http://www.postfix.org/) that has a reputation for being difficult to setup,so I long avoided it.  Once I decided to actually make with the go, it turned out to not be terribly difficult, though I did have to do a bit of searching to get exactly what I wanted.

There are a number of [good](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/304510:weekend-project-setting-up-a-vpn-on-your-linux-router-or-gateway) [tutorials](http://www.itsatechworld.com/2006/01/29/how-to-configure-openvpn/) for setting up OpenVPN, and the following instructions will mostly mirror those.  First, install the requisite packages:

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~$ sudo aptitude install openvpn
</pre>

Then, setup a place to generate the requisite keys:

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~$ mkdir tmp/vpn && cd vpn
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ cp -r /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0/* .
</pre>

At this point, many tutorials (the above mentioned ones included) say that you should run `./init-config`, which doesn't exist in recent version OpenVPN.  With the scripts for generating keys in place, open up `vars` and edit the stuff at the bottom, which should be pretty straightforward:

<pre class="brush: bash">
    export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
    export KEY_PROVINCE="NY"
    export KEY_CITY="Rochester"
    export KEY_ORG="Dinomite-Net"
    export KEY_EMAIL="drew@dinomite.net"
</pre>

The `vars` file just sets up a bunch of environment variables, so you'll want to source it and then build the certificate authority:

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ source vars
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./clean-all
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-ca
</pre>

Building the certificate authority involves a few questions, for most of which the defaults defined from `vars` are all you need.  Next, build the keys for the server and client (I name my computers [after Roman emperors](http://dinomite.net/2009/caligulas-giant-ship/)):

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-key-server caligula
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-key vespasian
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ ./build-dh
</pre>

With all that done, you can copy the appropriate key files over to the client, in my case `vespasian`.  Since I already had [tunnelblick](http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/) on that machine, I put the files directly where they needed to go:

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~/tmp/vpn$ cd keys
caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ scp vespasian.crt vespasian.key \
    ca.crt vespasian:~/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations/
</pre>

Two steps left.  First, make the client configuration file.  For tunnelblick, this goes in the same directory as above, and you can name it whatever you want:

<pre class="brush: bash">
    vespasian:~$ cat Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations/client.conf
    client
    dev tun
    proto udp
    remote caligula.dinomite.net 1194
    resolv-retry infinite
    nobind
    persist-key
    persist-tun
    ca ca.crt
    cert vespasian.crt
    key vespasian.key
    comp-lzo
    verb 3
</pre>

There are plenty of other sites that will explain what all of those options mean, so I won't go over it here.  The important things to change from above are the `remote` and the names for the `cert` and `key`.  Now on to the server config and the files that it needs:
    
<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ cp dh1024.pem caligula.key caligula.crt /etc/openvpn/
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ cat /etc/openvpn/server.conf
    server 10.7.7.0 255.255.255.0
    push "redirect-gateway"

    dev tun0
    proto udp
    keepalive 10 120
    comp-lzo
    dh /etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem
    ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
    cert /etc/openvpn/caligula.dinomite.net.crt
    key /etc/openvpn/caligula.dinomite.net.key

    status /var/log/openvpn-status.log
    verb 3
</pre>

The secret sauce in that config is `push "redirect-gateway"` which is what tells the client to route all of its traffic through the tunnel to the server.  To make this work, the server needs to be set up to do [NAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation):

<pre class="brush: bash">
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    caligula:~/tmp/vpn/keys$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.7.7.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</pre>

That's all there is to it!  Just restart the server (`sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart`), connect, and all your traffic is now safely encrypted to the server.

Is it possible to set up the routing so that the client can only access certain destinations? For instance, I might want to restrict the traffic emanating from the VPN, on the server side of the tunnel, so that the client can only access the Internet (through my router), but never reach the local network where the server sits, or the server itself. What would be a secure way to set that up in iptables?

Very nice. I've been wanting to do this for awhile for a project I'm working on. Here's a question: what if I wanted semi-random client to have access to my VPN? As in, if I had a remastered bootable linux CD, that I wanted to automatically connect to my VPN on boot, how would I go about this considering each key for each specific client is apparently painstakingly created -beforehand- in this example. Is there -any- way with OpenVPN to have a dynamically created key?

[Drivers' schools](http://www.nccbmwcca.org/content.php?120-driving-school) are incredibly fun and the best way to improve your driving prowess.  [Track days](http://www.nasaproracing.com/hpde/) can be incredibly useful for honing your skill once you have been on track enough to catch your own mistakes.  While incredibly useful tools for learning to drive fast, neither can touch the [24 Hours of LeMons](http://www.24hoursoflemons.com/) for having fun with motorsports.  I have previously written about [the basics of getting to a LeMons race](http://dinomite.net/2010/how-bvd-skidmark-got-to-goin-for-broken/), and what happened at [our first race](http://dinomite.net/2010/bvd-skidmarks-first-24-hours-of-lemons/).  The team just finished another race, the 2010 Arse-Freeze-Apalooza at Buttonwillow this past weekend, where we finished 68th of 173.  Better than half made us happy, because the head gasket blew with an hour and a half left in the race.

Track driving is certainly a specialized skill and racing is a step beyond that--in addition to driving a car at the limit, you have to deal with numerous other cars on track who may decide to pass you at any time.  In crapcan racing things are even crazier because most folks don't care much if the car gets hit and many of them have little to no experience driving on a racetrack, much less in anger.

Track Experience
==============
The biggest piece of advice I can give is to get some track experience before heading out on track in your first LeMons race.  Street driving, or even autocross shares very little with driving on a racetrack, and there is no adequate preparation aside from sufficient time on a track.  Even if you have done a lemons race, going to a much less crowded HPDE or other track even twill be very information--rare are the times you get to take an unmolested line, much less lap, at a race.

Many Races
==========
<a href="http://mpierce.org/gallery/v/motorsport/2010-12-lemons/2010-12-lemons-00097.jpg.html"><img alt="F'ed Up Racing" src="http://mpierce.org/gallery/d/4509-2/2010-12-lemons-00097.jpg" width="400" height="267" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
The first time you go to a 24 Hours of LeMons event, you'll find at least three different types of race teams: those who built something that doesn't belong on a racetrack; the teams there to win; and the teams that are just there to have fun in any way possible.  Don't get me wrong, everyone is there to have fun, but the former two have very specific goals in mind.  The folks who bring a [Fiat 600](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/12/and-the-real-winner-is-2/) or a [limousine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/43812942@N06/5233878618/in/set-72157625406524427/) aren't interested in winning the race outright--they're looking for the [Index of Effluency](http://jalopnik.com/5068138/index-of-effluency-bar-set-unreasonably-high-for-thunderhill-peugeot-505-turbo-or-chevy-corvair), or simply testing their own mechanical mettle.

By the same token, some teams come with the intent to win the speed race--they have a reliable, quick car, know how to do fast pit stops, and don't intend to spend time in the penalty box.  If it's not obvious who these teams are, check the time sheets after a couple hours of racing; they are the ones on the lead lap or just behind.  Figure out which cars belong in this group, do your best to stay out of their way, and certainly don't hit them.

Caution Wave
===========
If you've done other racing or track days, one of the first things you'll notice about crapcan racing is the number of yellow flags thrown.  When you have hundreds of $500 cars on a racetrack with inexperienced drivers, problems happen often.  At the Arse-Freeze-Apalooza, Jay said that the recovery crew did 75 tows on Saturday alone.  Oftentimes, cautions will be thrown well ahead of what you can see if you're closely following a pack of cars.  For this reason, you'll see folks who have been racing a while throw up their hand by the rear-view mirror and wave when they see a yellow flag.  This way, everyone behind knows that they are going to slow for caution, and you should too.

BODY:
Though not a first choice for long-running processes, many web shops end up writing daemons or batch processing scripts in PHP.  As business grows, the need to process records more quickly to deal with traffic becomes an issue.  Often times, the processing is limited by something other than raw processing power--network latency and database query times being the usual slowdowns.  When this is the case, the easiest way to increase throughput is with multiprocessing: multiple children that spread the time waiting so as the fully utilize the processing power available.

To this end, I have created a simple framework for managing child/worker multiprocessing in PHP.  Like other high-level interpreted languages, the most straightforward way to spin things up is using `fork(2)` to create new processes.  While not as Hardcore and Awesome as the lightweight threads that other languages provide, OS-level process creation isn't a huge hindrance if you code for it: make the child processes long running so as to mitigate the startup cost.  

The framework is part of the [Team Lazer Beez Open Source](https://launchpad.net/genius) project--you can find it in the [utility](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~genius.com/genius/trunk/view/head:/php/Utility/) package.  The entire thing is simple enough to fit in a single class, [gosUtility_Parallel](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~genius.com/genius/trunk/view/head:/php/Utility/lib/gosUtility/Parallel.cls.php), the basics of which can be credited to [chaos'](http://stackoverflow.com/users/47529/chaos) [post on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/752214/php-daemon-worker-environment/752255#752255).

Using the library is simple--extend gosUtility_Parallel and override the `doWorkChildImpl()` method:
<pre class="brush: php">
// Include the Genius config file
require_once dirname(dirname(__FILE__)) .'/Core/testConfig.inc.php';

class Minimal extends gosUtility_Parallel {
    protected function doWorkChildImpl() {
        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug($this->workerID . " started");
        usleep(2000000);

        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug($this->workerID . " doing work");
        usleep(2000000);

        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->info($this->workerID . " finishing");
        exit(1);
        return;
    }
}
</pre>

This class creates simple workers that print a couple of debug messages with some sleeping in between, and then announce that they are done working.  Now you can instantiate the class with a single argument: the number of children to run.  gosUtility_Parallel will take care of all the details.

<pre class="bursh: php">
// Make with the go
$minimal = new Minimal(2);
$minimal->go();
</pre>

If children `exit` with a non-zero status, the parent will spin up a replacement.  The parent will continue to run until all children have exited normally, or it gets `INT` (say, ctrl+c) or `TERM` (the default signal sent by kill(1)), in which case it will pass that signal on to the children, ensure they shut down, and then end itself.  gosUtility_Parallel provides ample logging information; running the above produces the following output:

<pre>
INFO - Started worker 0 (pid 42093)
DEBUG - 0 started
INFO - Started worker 1 (pid 42094)
DEBUG - 1 started
DEBUG - 0 doing work
DEBUG - Checking worker 0 (pid 42093)
DEBUG - Checking worker 1 (pid 42094)
DEBUG - 1 doing work
INFO - 0 finishing
INFO - 1 finishing
DEBUG - Checking worker 0 (pid 42093)
INFO - Worker 0 (pid 42093) exited normally
DEBUG - Checking worker 1 (pid 42094)
INFO - Worker 1 (pid 42094) exited normally
</pre>

gosUtility_Parallel provides a number of overrideable methods whose names explain their purpose: `parentSetup()`, `parentCleanup()`, and `childCleanup()`.  Children can also get their `$workerID` and the `$maxWorkers` number making processing based upon modular division trivial.  The [example parallel class](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~genius.com/genius/trunk/view/head:/php/Utility/parallel.php) in the distribution demonstrates some of these features:

<pre class="brush: php">
// Include the Genius config file
require_once dirname(dirname(__FILE__)) .'/Core/testConfig.inc.php';

class Par extends gosUtility_Parallel {
    public function __construct($maxWorkers) {
        parent::__construct($maxWorkers);

        // Redefine the logger
        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger = Log5PHP_Manager::getLogger('gosParallel.Par');
    }

    protected function doWorkChildImpl() {
        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug($this->workerID . " started");

        // Run until told not to
        global $run;
        while ($run) {
            gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug($this->workerID . " doing work.");
            usleep(2000000);
            if ($this->workerID == 0 && rand(0,10) == 7) {
                gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->info($this->workerID . " returning");
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    protected function parentCleanup() {
        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug("Parent cleaning up");
    }

    protected function childCleanup() {
        gosUtility_Parallel::$logger->debug($this->workerID . " cleaning up");
    }
}
</pre>

The example above runs out-of-the-box (provided your PHP was built with <a href="http://us.php.net/pcntl">`--enable-pcntl`</a>, so I encourage you to [download the source](https://launchpad.net/genius) and take it for a test drive.

Incidently, if you're in the Perl world you can just use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parallel-ForkManager/lib/Parallel/ForkManager.pm">Parallel::ForkManager</a> and be on your way.

BODY:
<p>On any machine I use I create a directory, sandbox, at the root of my home directory to hold checkouts of source code I'm working on.  This directory often contains code from many different repositories, dozens of projects that I intermittently work on.  Many of these repositories depend on others, in particular Java submodules for <a href="http://clearspring.com/">Clearspring</a>, and I want to be able to easily update all of them at once.  With Subversion this is easy: the <code>svn</code> command allows you to act upon a checkout without being in the directory that contains it.  Simply issuing <code>svn up *</code> from <code>~/sandbox</code> ensures that I have the latest code revision in each of my checkouts and <code>svn st *</code> allows me to see if I have any uncommited changes.</p>

<p>While I love Git, it does not make such actions this simple.  Git requires you to be in the repository directory (or set a number of environment variables) to work wit that repo.  While the <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/235455/bash-script-to-perform-an-action-on-each-subdirectory-in-a-directory"><code>-exec</code> option of <code>find(1)</code></a> allows me to descend into each directory and perform an action, I wanted to make this easy, because such all-checkout-actions are something that I want to do a number of times each day.  Like most problems, this one is (best?) solved with Perl.  Enter <a href="https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs">App::CmdDirs</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/raw/master/bin/cmddirs">CmdDirs</a> is a fairly simple Perl app that I have written to do what I describe above--descend into any number of directories and perform a command in each one.</p>

<pre>titus:~/sandbox$ ls
CmdAll                 mac-itunes             genius-os
scoreboard             GAE                    hf
uaParser               WebService-LOC-CongRec iTunes-Sync
titus:~/sandbox$ cmddirs "git st"
Performing `git st` in &lt;cmdall&gt;
## master
?? App-CmdDirs-1.00.tar.gz

Performing `git st` in &lt;itunes-sync&gt;
## master

Performing `git st` in &lt;uaparser&gt;
## master
 M uaParser/test/test_user_agent.py

Performing `git st` in &lt;webservice-loc-congrec&gt;
## master
</pre>

See the numerous directories? Note that there are 9 directories in my `sandbox` but `git st` was only performed in a few of them, those which are Git repositories.  CmdDirs has a modicum of intelligence: if it knows what your command is, the command will only be performed in applicable directories.  This can be overridden with `-all`, `-git`, or `-svn` doing what you expect.  Git and Subversion are the only two things supported right now, because that's all I have a need for. Writing new [Traversers](https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/tree/master/lib/App/CmdDirs/Traverser) is simple--just copy the form of git.pm or svn.pm.  You can probably Achieve at this endeavor even without knowing Perl.

Here's a one-liner for installing `cmddirs`:

<pre>
curl https://github.com/dinomite/CmdDirs/raw/master/bin/cmddirs > ~/bin/cmddirs && chmod a+x ~/bin/cmddirs
</pre>

There are a [number](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/3397688384/curried-beef-broccoli-slaw-mushroom-frittata) of [recipes](http://www.norcalsc.com/index.php/post/egg_cupcakes_to_go/) for [paleo](http://everydaypaleo.com/2010/03/24/egg-cupcakes/) [muffins](http://paleoblocks.blogspot.com/2010/08/breakfast-muffins.html), which are a great way to get fast [paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) food in the morning.  As I usually do with cooking, I created my own recipe from the ones I found online.  For 24 muffins, I assembled:

 - 18 eggs
 - 5 small sausages (breakfast size)
 - 2 large sausages
 - 1 red pepper
 - 1 large onion
 - 1/2 cup strained yogurt (Greek style)

The odd sausage arrangement is simply because that is what I had on hand--once cooked and crumbled it was about 2 &frac12; cups worth of sausage.

I began by cooking the sausage, followed by sautéing the diced onion & pepper in the fat that rendered out of the sausage.  After cracking all of the eggs into a a large bowl, I whisked them together with the yogurt.  With all of that assembled, I combined the sausage with the pepper & onion and portioned it into a pair of muffin pans.  The eggs are the last thing before the oven, filling each cup &#8532;rds full.  Into the oven for 15 minutes, rotate top/bottom pan, and give them another 7-10.  The bottoms of mine were a bit under cooked, so I might try putting the lower rack all the way down, rather than the standard in-the-middle.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510688763/in/set-72157626102609509/"><img alt="Finished platform" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5510688763_2a99df1c6d.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
CrossFit got me started on Olympic lifting and it is now one of my favorite things that I do in the exercise realm.  The tools needed for CrossFit are few and generally inexpensive, but Oly lifting does require some significant outlay if you plan on doing it at home.  One of the things you need is a platform upon which to perform lifts--it's important to have a stable, flat surface to stand on, and have the ability to drop weights.  Before going through with building a platform I dumped a light bar on my brick patio and the back yard, both of which left marks.  It was time for me to build a platform.

The basic arrangement of a platform is simple: a sufficiently wide patch of wood to stand on flanked by rubber to absorb dropped weights.  There are a [handful](http://straighttothebar.com/articles/2009/03/diy_how_to_build_an_olympic_we/index.html) of [notes](http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=20752) on building platforms online, most of which suggest two base layers made from full sheets of 3/4" plywood topped with a third half-sheet of 3/4" plywood with horestall mats on either side.  Simple enough, but these instructions also usually state that the resulting device cannot be lifted by on person alone.  I wanted to have the ability to at least flip my platform on end by myself to get it out of the way, so I took a different route.  To keep the weight more reasonable, I used 3/8" (11/32" at your local lumber yard) plywood and reduced the fore to aft dimension from 8 feet to 6, making for an 8 foot wide by 6 foot long platform.  In practice, this is plenty of space to perform lifts, even if you're doing some real speed as part of a <a href="http://crossfit.com">CrossFit</a> workout.

Materials:

 - Two 6x8 foot sheets of cheap 11/32 plywood
 - Two 4x6 foot sheets of cheap 11/32 plywood
 - One 4x6 foot sheet of nice 11/32 plywood
 - Construction adhesive
 - 150 3/4 inch wood screws

Assembly is a very simple affair:

 1.  Lay the 6x8 sheets with their long edges side by side (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510660609/in/set-72157626102609509/">photo</a>)
 2.  Apply construction adhesive to half of 6x8 sheet pair and top with one of the 4x6 sheets
 3.  Drill & screw edges every 6 to 10 inches, and put screws all over the interior as well--it's OK to put screws anywhere, as you won't be standing on this portion
 4.  Top with weights to ensure layers bond evenly  (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510661483/in/set-72157626102609509/">photo</a>)
 5.  Apply adhesive to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5511260930/in/set-72157626102609509/">other half</a>, top with remaining 4x6 sheet, and repeat screwing process
 6.  Test fit 4x6 piece of nice plywood in the center of the previously assembled parts and mark edges
 7.  Apply adhesive to the platform between marks, lay nice plywood down and secure with screws along front & back (4 foot) edges only
 8.  Put a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5510663107/in/set-72157626102609509/">crapton of weights</a> on top to ensure your platform comes out flat
 9.  Once everything is dry, give it a coat of deck sealant to make it waterproof

The end result is a platform that can (just barely) be dragged by one person.  If I were doing this whole thing again, I'd take one more foot off of each dimension, making for a 5 by 7 foot platform and saving significant weight in the process.  I think this would sill leave enough room for any sort of lifting.

Shortly after the release of [The Daily](http://www.thedaily.com), [Andy Baio](http://waxy.org) created [The Daily: Indexed](http://thedailyindexed.tumblr.com) and, more importantly, described how he created that index in [a blog post](http://waxy.org/2011/02/how_i_indexed_the_daily/).  The crux of his reverse engineering of The Daily app was [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com), which he describes how to use in the aforementioned blog post.  Since reading that post, I've wanted to explore a number of applications on my iPad and iPhone to see what they're really doing when they cause the network indicator to spin.

First things first, I setup Charles and started up [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/), an RSS feed reader that integrates tightly with Google Reader.  My main interest was to see when it actually marked posts as read--I often read in short spurts on my iPhone, which results in pulling up a post only to switch out of Reeder or lock my phone seconds later.  Sometimes the posts would be marked read if I pulled up Google Reader, but sometimes they were still marked unread.  Was this a network latency problem when the phone was using 3G/Edge internet, or was it Reeder doing some fanciness with when it marked posts read?

I didn't get to my goal right away because the first thing I noticed upon starting up Reeder is that it hits the original blog for every single one of the feeds that I subscribed to in Google Reader.  As someone who hasn't cleaned up a number of blogs that don't post anymore, this was a few hundred feeds.  I shouldn't have been surprised by this, as it doesn't really make sense for Google to pull all of the content for all of those blogs and package it up for my convenience.

Getting back to my initial focus, Reeder attempts to mark a post read as soon as you open a post--any failure of a post being marked read is because the network was slow or inoperative at the time you were reading.  Reeder periodically refreshes all of your feeds, as indicated by the spinning icon on the iPad or the replaced battery display on the iPhone, but it actually spends much longer doing this than the icon's state would lead you to believe.  From day-to-day usage the update to the feeds I care about (read: those that actually have updates) is done in short order, but Charles reveals that Reeder is still pulling data from individual websites.  My guess is that Reeder pulls the feed list from Google, gets the new posts mentioned therein, and then proceeds to do its own checking of feeds.

Reeder was the only app that had really crossed my mind after Andy Baio's post, and it fulfilled my desire to experiment with Charles, which is a very good tool that I'll turn to if I have future questions that need answering.

<a href="http://www.fitbomb.com/p/why-i-eat-paleo.html"><img alt="Go Paleo" src="http://dinomite.net/assets_c/2011/05/Go%20Paleo-thumb-500x500-2.jpg" width="400" height="400" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>
I have learned a *lot* about nutrition in the past few years, mainly fueled by my interest in fitness.  Once I got beyond run-of-the-mill [Globo Gym](http://rehobothcrossfit.com/2010/08/19/globo-gym-vs-crossfit-gym/) workouts by delving into truly challenging fitness like [parkour](http://www.americanparkour.com) and [CrossFit](http://crossfit.com), it became apparent that I would need to match exercise with proper nutrition in order to excel.  Note: if you don't give a shit about what I've done and just want to learn about nutrition, <a href="#information">head to the bottom</a>.

In The Beginning, There Was Parkour
=============================
Training at [Primal Fitness](http://www.primal-fitness.com/) was the first time I came across folks who offered dietary advice that wasn't focused on weight loss--something I haven't ever been interested in or needed.  Right in line with the nature of the parkour community at the time, the focus of nutrition was pretty loose: eat more protein and less sugar.  Like any athlete trying to build muscle, eating more protein than that on a [standard American diet (SAD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pattern_diet) is mostly a no brainer.  Weight lifting folks long ago figured out that protein was essential to building muscle, and in recent years it's common knowledge since we all see [Bros](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bro) downing their [protein powder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMOh-cul6M#t=1m40s).  Less sugar has [almost always been](http://www.westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/475-principles-of-healthy-diets) generally accepted as good nutrition advice...at least until it was pushed out by the blind fear of fat...but I'm getting ahead of myself.

The Next Level: CrossFit
=====================
I picked up CrossFit from hanging out at Primal Fitness, and largely as a way to get better at parkour.  Parkour involves lots of short distance sprinting with long distance running and a large amount of gymnastic strength & jumping.  What better to train such a diverse set of skills than the [general purpose fitness focus](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/what-crossfit.html) of CrossFit?  Indeed, Primal is also a CrossFit box in addition to being the first facility in the US with such a focus on Parkour.  What does CrossFit have to say about nutrition?  Quite a bit, and it's a significant part of the famous World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:

> Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc, hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.

Enter The Zone
============
The main [dietary message from CrossFit HQ](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/start-diet.html) is that [The Zone Diet](http://zoneperfect.com/nutrition-program) is the best set of guiding principals for optimum nutrition.  As much as it may seem on the face of it, this isn't just some marketing cross-promotion crap--much like CrossFit you don't need to buy anything to eat Zone.  The basic tenet is that your meals should all be made up of 40% energy (calories) provided by carbohydrates, 30% by protein, and 30% by fat ([the food pyramid advises](http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Energy-Carbohydrate-Fiber-Fat-Fatty-Acids-Cholesterol-Protein-and-Amino-Acids.aspx) about 55:20:25).  Zone prescribes that the carbohydrates you eat be of the low-glycemic index variety: vegetables, whole grains, whole fruit, though [some argue](http://robbwolf.com/2009/11/24/the-black-box-summit-or-how-i-got-fired-from-the-crossfit-nutrition-certification/) that this is offered as secondary to the macronutrient ratio that is the center of Zone.

I gave Zone a solid try while doing CrossFit on my own in 2009 and really liked it--when I managed to stick to the relatively low carbohydrate formula for even a few days I had much more stable energy throughout the day and felt ready to tackle the workout of the day whether I decided to do it first thing in the morning or late in the evening.  For a couple of years, I more-or-less followed the Zone and was pretty happy.  When I moved back to DC, I started CrossFitting at [Potomac CrossFit](http://www.potomaccrossfit.com) right around the time they were starting a Paleo Challenge, which encourages people to give a strict paleo diet a try for 30 days.  While I didn't participate in the challenge, I figured it was worth reading up on paleo and giving it a try since I had heard so much about it in the CrossFit community.

Where I End Up: Paleo
===================
I picked up [Robb Wolf](http://robbwolf.com/)'s book, [The Paleo Solution](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/005236.php) and, after initially being off-put by the self-help, anecdotal nature at the beginning of the book, I was impressed with the scientific information and references provided later.  Over the week I read the book I quickly moved from "I'll give this paleo thing a bit of a try" to "I will only eat grass-fed beef and organic broccoli cooked in coconut oil".  I found it so convincing in part because of the science, but also the back-to-basics origin for the ideas on nutrition.  As anyone who has read widely on [modern nutritionism](http://www.goodhealth.com/articles/2008/04/07/the_age_of_nutritionism_and_pitfalls_of_the_western_diet) knows, the dietary advice offerings in the past 50 years have done nothing to make Americans or Westerners in general any healthier.  Things like margarine are pushed as healthier replacements only to later find that partially hydrogenated fats are supremely deadly.

Paleo starts by saying, "Nutrition is so complex we haven't come close to understanding it enough scientifically to offer complete dietary advice."  Instead, paleo nutrition bases the nutrition guidelines on what we evolved to eat, that is the foods that sustained humans for the hundreds of thousands of years prior to the rise of agriculture.  Since we have arguably evolved very little since the products of agriculture (grains, legumes) became the central part of our diet, about 10,000 years ago, looking back to what our evolution had us eating seems a very good start.  We need not attempt to reenact the caveman lifestyle, but we can use the diets of our evolutionary ancestors as a logical framework for making nutrition choices in the modern world.

In so many words, that is my nutritional journey--I am now a complete paleo convert.  After trying it for a month, I was absolutely hooked and, a lot like CrossFit, I now try to tell everyone I meet about how awesome this paleo thing is.  In addition to never suffering from [blood sugar fluctuation induced unhappiness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO_uJVL8KkA) I am also not only ready to tackle workouts whenever, but reading to absolutely own them.  Beyond that, the dietary guidelines of paleo fall in line with a [wide set of evidence](http://www.dovepress.com/the-western-diet-and-lifestyle-and-diseases-of-civilization-peer-reviewed-article-RRCC) showing that modern diets are wrong in so many ways I really believe that eating this way makes me greatly healthier overall.

<a name="information">Information on Nutrition</a>
==================
The original point of this post was not to just tell my story of nutritional discovery, but to let others know what they should read to understand nutrition.  I never like to just tell people what they should eat, because that makes me just another guy hocking advice that Really Will Make Everything Better!  Instead, I want to give folks the information to make their own decision--and I think the evidence points so strongly in one direction that anyone who does read up on it will be in the same camp that I'm in.

If you're just getting interested in nutrition, then these are the articles you should read.  If you don't care about nutrition, I would encourage you to at least read those by Michael Pollan: they paint a pretty grim picture of the food supply in the United States

* [Unhappy Meals](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?_r=1&ref=magazine&oref=slogin) - Michael Pollan
* [Power Steer](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/magazine/power-steer.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm) - Michael Pollan
* [What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html?pagewanted=all) - Gary Taubes
* [Principles of Healthy Diets](http://www.westonaprice.org/abcs-of-nutrition/475-principles-of-healthy-diets) - Weston A Price Foundation

For those who want to know more, a good next step is to check out some documentaries:

* [Fathead (2009)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Head_%28documentary%29) - A response to [Super Size Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperSize_Me) that effectively presents the flaws of the [lipid hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_hypothesis)
* [King Corn (2007)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Corn_%28film%29) - On the American industrialized food system

To really understand what nutrition is about, book reading is in order:

* [Why We Get Fat](http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702) - A much longer version of the Gary Taubes article above explaining the history & details of modern nutrition advice
* [The Omnivore's Dilemma](http://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1304302727&sr=8-1) - Michael Pollan's book that introduced nutritionism and its failings, and describes the industrial food system in detail, contrasting it with local agriculture
* [In Defense of Food](http://www.amazon.com/Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1304302881&sr=8-1) - More on food & nutritionism. This is where "Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly plants" comes from
* [The Vegetarian Myth](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/vegetarian-myth-review/) - A very striking and thorough tearing apart of every angle of vegetarianism written by a former long-time vegan

If you really want to have a thorough understanding of the lipid hypothesis, Gary Taubes wrote another book that is basically Why We Get Fat with even more scientific evidence and why the calories in-calories out model for obesity doesn't work entitled [Good Calories, Bad Calories](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1304302628&sr=8-1).

To get an idea of this whole Paleo thing that I have fallen in love with check out these things, in order of brevity (read: depth):

* [Whole 9's The Paleo Pitch](http://whole9life.com/2010/05/the-paleo-pitch/)
* [Robb Wolf's Paleo Overview](http://robbwolf.com/faq/#overview)
* [Fit Bomb's What Is Paleo?](http://www.fitbomb.com/p/why-i-eat-paleo.html)
* [The Paleo Solution](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/005236.php) - Robb Wolf's book on the paleo diet (which I reviewed on [Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools))
* [The Paleo Diet](http://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Diet-Weight-Healthy-Designed/dp/0470913029/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1304303375&sr=8-3) - Dr. Loren Cordain, another big name in the paleo community
* [The Primal Blueprint](http://www.amazon.com/Primal-Blueprint-Reprogram-effortless-boundless/dp/0982207700/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1304303375&sr=8-8) - I haven't read Mark Sisson's book, but I do read his [very good blog](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/)

I say if you're going to espouse the paleo option, you should also let people know the best way to get the food OUT of their bodies after it's gone in.  

Squatting.  The only way to counteract the slow hip death brought on by office chairs.  And the only way to take a dump.

Great summary.  I'm also looking for some anti-paleo lit, to get a sense of what those recent arguments are.  I'll tell you though that since watching attentively for ~5 months what I actually eat, and generally avoiding fat, I am generally also damn hungry.

The biggest source of anti-paleo information is, to sound a bit conspiratorial, the established views of the government & medical community.  The standard food pyramid (now MyPyramid) with its base of grains, admonishment to eat little fat, and emphasis on calorie counting is pretty thoroughly anti-paleo.  The other group that is in stark contras to paleo would be the generally accepted "healthy" or "clean" eating folks, who tend to eschew fat to an extreme degree and eat little or completely avoid meat.

Probably the extreme opposite of paleo would be raw fruit vegans, who are positively crazy—2 liters of orange juice for breakfast, 50 bananas throughout the rest of the day, and waking up to pee a couple of times at night.  Sounds great.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UK-aX0_fAw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UK-aX0_fAw</a>

BODY:
I quite enjoy exercising and, ever since I did parkour, I've really liked body weight movements. I don't do much in the way of parkour any more, but I do CrossFit [religiously](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5722067913/in/photostream), which features a *lot* of pull-ups.  I've got a [doorway pull-up bar](http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Total-Upper-Body-Workout/dp/B001EJMS6K/ref=sr_1_7) which is superb for just getting going in the morning; since they're only $25, I think everyone should have (and use) one.  While having a pull-up bar inside the house is great, I do most of my real workouts in my garage--with easy access to running (the street), box jumps (wall in my back yard), and a barbell, I can do many different [WODs](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0).  For WODs that involve pull-ups, I've been doing them on the rafters in the garage.  While this works, the rafters are a bit too high to get to easily and they *really* strain my grip.  I'm all for the workout being difficult, but I don't always want it to be training for climbing.  To that end, I built a pull-up bar this weekend.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5749073468/in/photostream"><img alt="pull-up bar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/5749073468_34876074a9.jpg" width="500" height="164" class="mt-image-center" /></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5748521987/in/set-72157626658390219/"><img alt="bolt detail" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2160/5748521987_81c1001769_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
It's a pretty simple affair, largely based upon [this instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4vk4M-Vr5o).  The pull-up bar runs perpendicular to a pair of rafters that are 4 feet apart, hanging a few inches below the bottom of the rafters.  In my garage, the rafters are 2x6, which seem to be plenty sturdy enough even when I kip & do muscle-ups over the bar.

The materials I used for the bar:

  * A 48" long, 1" diameter pipe
  * Two 12" long 2x6s
  * Two 6" long 2x6s
  * Six 4" long 3/8" bolts
  * Six 3/8" nuts
  * Twelve flat washers
  * Eight 2.5" long wood screws
  * Construction adhesive

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dinomite/5748523795/in/set-72157626658390219"><img alt="bolt detail" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3430/5748523795_25a4de0930_m.jpg" width="210" height="240" class="mt-image-right" /></a>
The only prep beyond cutting the wood is drilling the holes for the bar in the larger 2x6 pieces.  Note that a 1" diameter bar has a 1" *interior* diameter, so you need a larger drill bit than 1"; I used a 1¼" bit which was still slightly small, but worked with a bit of extra drill action.  Once the bar holes are drilled, I made the holes for the 3/8" bolts on the opposite half of the 2x6, and corresponding holes in the rafters where the bar was to be mounted.  My standard procedure for woodworking is to supplement my lackluster skill with adhesive, so I applied some construction adhesive with my caulk gun between the 2x6 and the rafter and then bolted it in place.

With the supports bolted in place, I slipped the bar itself through the holes and quickly discovered the need for something more.  The bar itself is 48 inches long, and the space between my rafters is also 48 inches.  Since I put the supports inside a pair of rafters, the bar was nicely flush with the outside of the supports, but this also meant it would only take a couple of inches of lateral movement for it to fall out.  The solution is to cap fashion caps using some more 2x6 and secure it with wood screws.

What's up Drew,

That's a pretty awesome setup, and definitely looks sturdy. The only limiting factor I can see is that it doesn't look like there's enough clearance at the top for muscle-ups... so you're kind of limited to pull-ups... then again, the roof is slanted up and it looks like you installed it right below the peak so maybe there is enough room?

The only structural issue I could see potentially happening is the 2x6 that has the hole in it splitting at the bottom, causing the pipe to break through and fall... but at least if this was to happen you'd have plenty of warning.

Have you ever seen that idiotic YouTube video of the guy doing pullups outside with a shower rod that he jammed between two walls? Not surprisingly, the rod slips and he lands on his back... his trainer who was watching the entire event totally freaks out... pretty hilarious.

Surprisingly, there actually is enough space to do a muscle up—I was definitely worried about that when putting it together and pleasantly surprised.  I hope you're right about plenty of warning, 'cause I sure don't want to have Fran interrupted like that!

BODY:
One of the very best things about Perl is [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/), a repository of modules to do everything from [browse the web](https://metacpan.org/module/WWW::Mechanize) to [manipulating image files](https://metacpan.org/module/Image::Magick).  CPAN provides a consistent method for installing modules ([install cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/module/App::cpanminus#Installing-to-system-perl) and then `cpanm <Module::Name>`) and the largest number of modules of all the scripting languages.  More often than not, what you are trying to do has already been done and exists as a CPAN module.  In the event you are doing something new, the best way to give back to the community and get free help is to encapsulate your work and distribute it as a module on CPAN.

Historically, creating a module suitable for general consumption was a confusing.  Tutorials [from years past](http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/perl/module_mechanics.html) abound, [each one longer](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=431702) [than the previous](http://members.pcug.org.au/~rcook/PerlModule_HOWTO.html), and [always employing a different toolchain](http://mathforum.org/~ken/perl_modules.html), making synthesis of common concepts impossible.  These days, however, things are much easier.  In the past 6 years or so the Perl community has tried on a [number](https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker) of [methods](https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build) for [building](https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Install) modules.  The focus of this article will be a recent (circa late 2009...the Perl ecosystem takes a measured pace) build system, [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla).

Whereas [ExtUtils::MakeMaker](https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker) and [Module::Build](https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build) are systems for building, testing, and installing a release, Dist::Zilla sits at a higher level.  With Dist::Zilla, you create a single file that controls the build & test flow (using [ExtUtils::MakeMaker](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker) under the hood) but also provide functionality for generating semi-boilerplate files (LICENSE, MANIFEST, META.yml) and releasing the code via CPAN.  The configuration file, `dist.ini`, is easy-to-read and short in contrast to prior build systems.

To start using Dist::Zilla, install it using the standard CPAN shell command (`cpan -i Dist::Zilla`) or with cpanminus (`cpanm Dist::Zilla`).  You utilize Dist::Zilla through the command `dzil`; if that's not in your path (`which dzil`), then you'll want to find it and symlink it somewhere useful or add it to your path.  Global setup of dzil is done by invoking `dzil setup` and answering the questions it poses.  With that done you can very easily mint a new distribution:

<pre class="brush: perl">
Titus:~/sandbox$ dzil new Number::Cruncher
[DZ] making target dir /Users/dinomite/Dropbox/sandbox/Number-Cruncher
[DZ] writing files to /Users/dinomite/Dropbox/sandbox/Number-Cruncher
[DZ] dist minted in ./Number-Cruncher
</pre>

In the newly created Number-Cruncher directory you'll find a `lib` directory containing `Number/Cruncher.pm` and a `dist.ini`
:
<pre class="brush: perl">
name    = Number-Cruncher
author  = Drew Stephens [drew@dinomite.net]
license = Perl_5
copyright_holder = Drew Stephens
copyright_year   = 2011

version = 0.001

[@Basic]
</pre>

At this point, code and tests are the only things needed to have a Perl module.  Here's some simple code for `lib/Number/Cruncher.pm`:

<pre class="brush: perl">
use strict;
use warnings;
package Number::Cruncher;

=head1 NAME

Number::Cruncher - crunch numbers

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {
        first => shift,
        second => shift,
    };
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}

sub crunch {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{first} + $self->{second};
}

1;
</pre>

And the associated test file that I created, `t/number-cruncher.t`:

<pre class="brush: perl">
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::More tests => 2;

BEGIN { use_ok 'Number::Cruncher'; }

my $first = 1;
my $second = 7;
my $cruncher = Number::Cruncher->new($first, $second);
ok (($first + $second) == $cruncher->crunch());
</pre>

In three files--`dist.ini`, `lib/Number/Cruncher.pm`, and `t/number-cruncher.t`--we have a module.  Run the test with `dzil test` and you'll see Dist::Zilla build your module into a temporary directory and run the test suite from there:

<pre class="brush: shell">
Titus:~/sandbox/Number-Cruncher$ dzil test
[DZ] building test distribution under .build/mgJsQhkFi6
[DZ] beginning to build Number-Cruncher
[DZ] guessing dist's main_module is lib/Number/Cruncher.pm
[DZ] extracting distribution abstract from lib/Number/Cruncher.pm
[DZ] writing Number-Cruncher in .build/mgJsQhkFi6
Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Writing Makefile for Number::Cruncher
cp lib/Number/Cruncher.pm blib/lib/Number/Cruncher.pm
Manifying blib/man3/Number::Cruncher.3
PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/Cellar/perl/5.12.3/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/*.t
t/number-cruncher.t .. ok   
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=2,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.01 sys +  0.02 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.05 CPU)
Result: PASS
[DZ] all's well; removing .build/mgJsQhkFi6
</pre>

To build a distributable tarball, just run `dzil build`:

<pre class="brush: shell">
Titus:~/sandbox/Number-Cruncher$ dzil build
[DZ] beginning to build Number-Cruncher
[DZ] guessing dist's main_module is lib/Number/Cruncher.pm
[DZ] extracting distribution abstract from lib/Number/Cruncher.pm
[DZ] writing Number-Cruncher in Number-Cruncher-0.001
[DZ] building archive with Archive::Tar::Wrapper
[DZ] writing archive to Number-Cruncher-0.001.tar.gz
Titus:~/sandbox/Number-Cruncher$ ls Number-Cruncher-0.001*
Number-Cruncher-0.001.tar.gz

Number-Cruncher-0.001:
LICENSE     META.yml    README      lib
MANIFEST    Makefile.PL dist.ini    t
</pre>

If you already have a PAUSE account, you can use `dzil release` to upload that tarball to PAUSE for inclusion in CPAN.  If you haven't authored a Perl module before, [request an account](http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id) for uploading modules to CPAN.  With PAUSE and Dist::Zilla, creating widely-available Perl modules is easy.

BODY:
In the past year, I have come to quite like [dubstep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep), a burgeoning electronic music genre.  Perhaps [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXO-jKksQkM) is a more interesting introduction than an article.  Dubstep's current phase reminds me of generalized techno (mostly house & dance) during the mid-90's--a huge variety of styles, many small artists, much of it distributed through non-traditional channels.  In the late 90's the distribution was via early filesharing networks, most notably Napster.  For Dubstep, [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=dubstep%20remix&aq=f), [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/dubstep/), and [Soundcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/dubstep/) seem to be the preferred ways of getting new tracks out.

To chronicle and share this growth of a genre, I started [@DailyWub](https://twitter.com/dailywub), a Twitter account that posts a new dubstep track every day.  Being an engineer, I found the idea of manually keeping a queue and posting a track every day to be a dreadful task.  For some time, the account has been powered by [Buffer](www.bufferapp.com), a simple webapp that allows you to create a queue of tweets that are metered out at a schedule of your choosing.  Buffer is ok, but they limit the queue to 10 tweets, and at some point started shortening URLs even when not needed, which breaks the YouTube thumbnails in many Twitter clients.  Having a queue that is regularly plucked from and emitted to Twitter is a fairly simple operation, so I wrote my own program to do it--[Net::Twitter::Queue](https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Twitter::Queue).

Net::Twitter::Queue is a simple Perl module that employs [Net::Twitter](https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Twitter) to do the heavy lifting.  To use it, I have a queue of tweets in a file, `tweets.yaml`:

<pre class="brush: bash">
- Caspa - Where's My Money? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myZU2DZoD9w
- Skrillex - First Of The Year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cXDgFwE13g
- Rusko - Everyday http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDAX2aVWAag
</pre>

When run, Net::Twitter::Queue will remove the top item from that YAML file and post it to Twitter using the account information specified in `config.yaml`:

<pre class="brush: bash">
consumer_key: [consumer_key]
consumer_secret: [consumer_secret]
access_token: [access_token]
access_token_secret: [access_token_secret]
</pre>

Where do those values come from?  Two places: the consumer information is on the page for your application at [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com) (go ahead, make one!) and the access tokens are specific to the account you want to post as.  To generate them, I used [Twurl](https://github.com/marcel/twurl).  With the consumer key & secret in hand, simply run Twurl:

<pre class="brush: bash">
Titus:~/$ twurl authorize --consumer-key [consumer_key] \
--consumer-secret [consumer_secret]
</pre>

Twurl will respond with a URL that you can visit in a web browser, login to Twitter with the account you want to post as, and get a PIN back.  Give the PIN to Twurl and it will complete the authentication process, saving the access token & associated secret in your `~/.twurlrc`.  Grab those two, toss them into `config.yaml` and run Net::Twitter::Queue from the directory that has `config.yaml` & `tweets.yaml` in it:

<pre class="brush: bash">
caligula:~/twitter/dailywub$ ls
config.yaml  tweets.yaml
caligula:~/twitter/dailywub$ perl -MNet::Twitter::Queue -e \
'$q=Net::Twitter::Queue->new->tweet'
</pre>

Easy as that--the top entry in `tweets.yaml` has been popped and posted to Twitter.

BODY:
There are enough BMW E36 cars out there owned by enthusiasts that nearly any problem you have there is a do-it-yourself tutorial for fixing on the internet. Dead window motors is no different--Doug Vetter has [a very detailed description](http://www.dvatp.com/bmw/diy/power_window/) of how to replace the window motor & regulator on the E36.  Seriously, if you're going to to do this fix (or are wondering whether you should, go check out Doug's page.  The only amendment I'll make to his description is about replacing the window motor only, without removing the regulator.  In short, doing so is possible, but a (cheap!) special tool is required.

Doug's instructions mention that a low-profile ratchet is required to remove the window motor with the regulator in place, and when he says low-profile, he means it.  I bought one of [these cheap ratchets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XYOUS6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dinomitenet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000XYOUS6) on Amazon in preparation for this job.  While it doesn't have the requisite T-30 bit, this style of ratchet is the only thing that will fit in the space between the door and de-riveted window regulator.  Check your local hardware store for the T-30 bit--regular old interchangeable screwdriver bits fit perfectly.  Beyond that, follow Doug's instructions for breaking the window regulator rivets, use your $9 ratchet to unbolt the motor, and bolt the shiny, expensive new motor in its place.  If you're handy, you'll be done in an hour.
