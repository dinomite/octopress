Since he was [mentioned on The Daily Show]() a few weeks ago, [Rick Ross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross_(rapper)) has quickly become my favorite rapper.  The king of repetition, Ross hails from Miami and makes much of his activities trafficking drugs despite [allegations that he worked for the man](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0721081rickross1.html) during part of his life.  Like many rappers, Rick Ross talks a lot about his expensive cars and I noticed a trend in the vehicles of which he spoke.

<a href="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series.jpg"><img src="http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/7series-300x172.jpg" alt="" title="BMW 7 Series" width="300" height="172" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-341" /></a>
In his first album, Port of Miami, Ross' makes a number of references to his white on white BMW 745i such as this line from the hit single *Hustlin'*:

<blockquote>
Who tha fuck you think ya fuckin with?  I'm tha fuckin boss<br>
745 white on white, thats fuckin Ross
</blockquote>

To be sure, any BMW 7 series is a fine car, but the 745i is the base model of the line.  Is Rick Ross a poor rapper?  Not too fast, in the song *White House*, he mentions a Rolls Royce Phantom:

<blockquote>
we in the white house<br>
big phantom on the lawn getting wiped down
</blockquote>

Is this song a fantasy about occupying the [White House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) proper, or is it simply hyperbole about his mansion, with a nod to cocaine usage and trade?  Given the previous mention of a 745i, I can only assume that the Phantom was but a fantasy for Rick Ross in 2006.

Times change.  In 2008, Rick Ross released the album *Trilla* and it sounds like he's had a significant upgrade.  The song *Luxury Tax*, makes specific mention of a 760, the top of the line BMW 7 Series:

<blockquote>
Got my whole arm rocked.<br>
Keep the 760 double parked in the wrong spot.
</blockquote>

The cover of the album also features the rapper in the back seat of a [Maybach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_57_and_62), the sole car from the eponymous ultra-luxury brand owned by [Mercedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes).  The album also includes a song *Maybach Music*, Ross says that he has 20 whips, one of which is a [Maserati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati).
