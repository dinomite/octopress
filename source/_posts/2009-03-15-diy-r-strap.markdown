After seeing the [BlackRapid R-Strap](http://www.blackrapid.com/) mentioned on [Photojojo](http://photojojo.com/content/buy-this/diy-camera-r-strap/) I knew that I wanted one for greater convenience when walking about with my camera.  I hate neck straps because they get in the way when you aren't using them and make you look like a fat tourist when you are.  I might as well break out the khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirt.  Aside from the not-exactly-cheap $50 price tag, I figured that and R-Strap was something I should DIY.

My version of the R-Strap is a simple affair, consisting of the plate off my Manfrotto ballhead and some gear from the climbing section of REI.  To begin with, I got myself a [2 foot long, 18mm runner](http://www.rei.com/product/722354) which I wear like a bandolier.  To this, I attach a simple [locking carabiner](http://www.rei.com/product/782255) - I just chose the smallest and cheapest one.  I thought about using chintzy keychain carabiners, but then realized I'll be hangning thousands of dollars of gear off of it and went with the slightly more expensive real thing.

Finally, I tied a small loop of [nylon cord](http://www.rei.com/product/784296) to the D-ring on my tripod plate, to which I clip the carabiner.  If your tripod plate has a large enough ring, you could clip directly to it.
