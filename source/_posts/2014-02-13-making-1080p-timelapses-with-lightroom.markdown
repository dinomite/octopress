There are [a bunch](http://photographyforrealestate.net/2012/09/09/how-to-use-lightroom-4-to-create-a-time-lapse-video/) of [tutorials](http://lightroom-blog.com/2013/09/17/timelapse-again-in-lightroom-5-2/) for creating time-lapse videos in Lightroom.  All of the ones I found only provide a preset for making 1280x720 (720p) videos.  I took one of those presets and updated it to be make a <a href="/assets/JPEG 82 (1080p).lrtemplate">1920x1080 (1080p) video from stills</a>.

Download this an add it to your Lightroom video presets.  On Mac, this is located at `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Lightroom/Export Presets/Video/`.  For Windows, [see here](http://store.apple.com/us)[^1].
