One of the rotating taglines in the subtitle of this website is the line that is the title of this post:
"You're tuned into Perfecto Radio, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles"

A few weeks ago, I receive and email from someone wondering which [Paul Oakenfold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Oakenfold) record it comes from, because my link simply pointed to the Wikipedia page for [Perfecto Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfecto_Records); apparently my site is the [only hit on Google](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=%22you%27re+tuned+into+perfecto+radio%2C+new+york+city%2C+miami%2C+los+angeles%22&btnG=Search) when you search for that phrase.  For the life of me, I couldn't remember, nor was I able to find it in a cursory search of my Oakenfold albums, which I informed the questioner.  I recently got a response and it turns out the line is at the beginning of the Chilled Eskimo's <em>Take Me Away</em> on Oakenfold's <strong>Perfecto Presents Another World</strong>.  Now this answer is forever recorded on the internet for all to know.

Just listening to this album again and at the end of Tatoine's <em>Music</em> a similar phrase is said, "You're tuned into Perfecto Radio, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle."
