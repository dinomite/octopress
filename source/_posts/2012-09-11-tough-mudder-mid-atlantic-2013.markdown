After not doing Tough Mudder [since 2010](http://dinomite.net/blog/2010/tough-mudder-norcal-2010/),
I signed up for the Mid-Atlantic event this year.  Here's my advice for folks
looking for tips before running.

Over the past few years I've exercised almost exclusively in [Vibram
FiveFingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/index.htm) mainly because I feel
so much more stable when running & jumping.  Since switching to minimalist
street shoes for everyday wear ([Merrell Trail Gloves](http://www.merrell.com/US/en-us/Product.mvc.aspx/22875M/50390/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Trail-Glove)
and [New Balance Minimus](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004KZP5AG/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B004KZP5AG&adid=05E13DHZT6EMTB01FEFZ))
my knees, hips, and back seem happier.  Last time I did Tough Mudder, I wore
some old cross-trainer style tennis shoes, but by this point I've gotten rid of
all the thick-soled tennis shoes I once had.  I ended up wearing my New Balance
MT20s for the run and they worked very well.  Clearning them after the race was
just a few minutes of hosing them off outside and then tossing them in the
washing machine.

I wore some Mechanix gloves (the basic velcro cuff model) the first time I did
Tough Mudder.  This time I brought some along but chose not to wear them. There
are only a couple of obstacles for which you might want them, and I don't think
those are sufficiently abrasive or splintery to extra mudweight you carry in
gloves.  Focus on wearing as little clothing as possible—the first time you hit
a mud pit your shirt & shorts carry a lot of it with you.

Training is another big question that people have.  Mine is pretty much the same
as previously: I do CrossFit 2-3 times a week and 1-2 days a week of Olympic
lifting.  In the 6 months prior to doing Tough Mudder I went on a couple of ~3.5
mile runs.  The only other running I did was the occasional CrossFit WOD that
involved a 400 or 800 meter run.  I think that pretty well drives home my
admonition that you don't need to run a lot to be a competent runner and perform
well in endurance running events.

Having said that, this Tough Mudder was the same as last—85% of the people walk
the majority of the event; another 10% run between half of the obstacles.
Running the whole way easily puts you in the top 5% of participants.  Aside from
being well prepared physically and highly self motivated, the best way to run
the whole way is to do it with a group of friends.
