Like any good [geek](http://www.geekcode.com), I have a naming system for my computers and associated devices.  Real systems &#x2014; which I define as those that run SSH &#x2014; are named after [Roman Emperors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_Emperors); things that are computer-like but don't run SSH are named after [Roman generals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_generals).

I have also taken to naming each of the disks attached to a machine after a land mass somehow connected to the Emperor it is named after.  My main desktop is [Caligula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula) with the disks [Capri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capri), where Caligula lived under the care of [Tiberius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius), [Mauretania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauretania), which Tiberius annexed, and [Germania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania), where Caligula accompanied his father on military campaigns as a young child.  When I got a USB drive for keeping off-site backups, I needed to name it and though ships of the [Roman Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Navy) would be appropriate.  What a pleasant surprise to find that Caligula had built a ship to transport the obelisk in [St. Peter's Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter%27s_Square) which when it was found in the 1950's was named [Caligula's "Giant Ship"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula%27s_Giant_Ship).
