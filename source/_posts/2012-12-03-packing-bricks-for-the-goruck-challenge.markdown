I have finally signed up for a [GORUCK Challenge](https://www.goruckchallenge.com/).  The event is 6 months off, but thanks to Jason posting [Wrapping Bricks Explained](http://www.gorucknews.com/challenge/wrapping-bricks-explained/) I've been playing around with packing bricks in my rucks.

I followed the instructions on the above mentioned post for wrapping the bricks in pairs and took Asha Wagner's [advice for securing the bricks](http://nuffsaid6.blogspot.com/2011/11/goruck-tough-sf-class-086.html) in a GORUCK pack using [Sea to Summit 3/4" straps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007A2XFYE/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dinomitenet-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B007A2XFYE&adid=14454BYTXX0X67M3EC7K&) to secure them on the ruck's internal [PALS webbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch_Attachment_Ladder_System).  To the right are two pairs of bricks (4 total) in a GR Echo.

I'm pretty light, just under 150 most days, so 4 bricks is the prescription.  A yoga block is the perfect thing to fill the extra spaceâ€”dense but soft and about the size of two bricks.  One note is that you can indeed fit 6 bricks into a GR Echo, with just a bit of room to spare.  The third package of bricks takes the place of the yoga block, with a bit of space on either side.  Unfortunately, there isn't nearly enough space for a hydration bladder along with them.  If you're taking 6 bricks to the Challenge, get a GR1 or Radio Ruck.
